Chapter 1
Fog
The first time they met, Erwin had fallen asleep in class. Not his best moment, but Constitutional Law was Constitutional Law and Erwin knew it like the back of his hand. Erwin jolted awake to the sound of something whooshing and he sat up from where he’d slumped over the open textbook, his pen still caught between his fingers. His first thought had been guilt — his father was paying for his education, and it was on Erwin to make sure every penny was spent squeezing as much learning out as possible.
The room had emptied of students as well as their professor, but Erwin had dozed off mid-highlighting the sections that he felt his professor had brushed over too lightly. He’d have to email his professor his questions. He previously found that went over a little better than calling out in the middle of the lecture.
“Are you leaving or what?”
Erwin looked up to see a strikingly small man wielding a vacuum on wheels, the long tube standing not much shorter than he was. He pressed his foot to the round part, and the whooshing stopped. He was wearing what Erwin presumed was a janitor’s boilersuit, only he’d unbuttoned it and removed the arms, tying them at his waist. His face was small and pointed, and the Descendents t-shirt several sizes too large for his frame. He looked too young to be a janitor, too young to be in this lecture hall even. Beyond where he was standing in front of Erwin, there was a small child now sitting at his professor’s desk beyond the podium, her face barely visible above the counter.
“Don’t you have a frat party to attend? Stop cluttering up my lecture hall. I have three other halls to clean after this one,” the man was speaking in a flat drawl, drawing Erwin’s eyes back to him.
“Perhaps I’m hallucinating,” Erwin said, but rubbed his eyes all the same. With finals approaching, and the stress that came with being the heir of a well-established law firm in the city, maybe it was all getting to him. “You seem too young to be a janitor and there’s a tiny child in the professor's place.”
“You ain’t seeing shit. Job’s a job,” the man said. Man didn’t seem right, Erwin didn’t feel much like a man yet and this one looked so much younger. A boy. Erwin’s eyes shifted passed the boy’s shoulder, to where the little red-haired girl had dropped her chubby cheek down to the desk in a gust of pantomime frustration. “And that’s not a child, that’s a gremlin.”
“Boooored!” she yelled in response, and it echoed in the empty lecture hall.
“Erwin.” He held out his own hand in greeting. His father had taught him politeness over nothing else and he’d been anything but polite by falling asleep and keeping the boy from his work. His hand stayed empty for a few long seconds, waiting on the boy-janitor to shake it. Eventually, he wrapped his fingers around Erwin’s. Very small; Erwin felt like he might crush him, so he kept his grip loose until enough time had passed for them to drop it. “What’s your name?”
“Why? Gonna report me? It’s not illegal to bring my kid to work. Wasn’t in the paperwork.”
“No, that wasn’t—” Erwin trailed off. The girl was no more than four, and the nameless boy looked like he belonged in high school still. “This is all feeling very surreal. Are you real or am I just overworked?”
“Overworked? Tch.” The boy folded his arms, the plastic tube of the vacuum snug between his chest and bicep. “You students don’t know a goddamn thing about overworked. Can you fuck off? Like I said I need to clean and I don’t like an audience.”
“I see.” Erwin nodded his head and stood, collecting his books and shoving them into his rucksack. He watched the boy stare unamused, before his eyes shifted up. By now the little girl - or gremlin - had grown bored with playing teacher and had rushed over. She plastered herself to the janitor’s leg, her wide green eyes peering up at Erwin curiously.
“Nice to meet you both,” Erwin said, smiling down at her until she tucked her face fully to the boy’s side in a frank coyness only found in the very young. He adjusted his bag over his shoulders and moved to leave. He’d kill them, he decided, those friends of his for letting him drool on rather than wake him as he would them.
“Levi.” Erwin turned at the boy’s voice. He’d turned on the vacuum again now, and the little girl had taken to twirling up the sides of the hall, watching the circle of her skirt flap as she span in circles. “Name’s Levi.”
“I’m Isabel,” the little girl said. “In case you wonder-ed.”
“Levi,” Erwin said, looking to Levi who nodded, as he ran the vacuum across the floor. The loud whooshing drowned out the rest of his words. “Isabel. Nice to meet you both.”
+++
Erwin’s mouth tasted like cotton and his throat was dry as he was pulled from his dream. Everything came to him in drips. The sense of breathing, the odd mechanical beeping noise, the dryness of his eyes, the heaviness of his chest. His throat felt shredded, flaky and swollen, but eventually his eyes opened.
Something blurred them to a plain white ceiling. He closed them until he tried again. Clinical. Hospital. His head throbbed, but felt dulled. Still, a cottony taste in his mouth. He needed water.
“Fuck. Oh shit, you’re awake!” The sound of a familiar voice by the side of him. His vision was poor on one side, but then Levi suddenly peeled into view. Dark hair in his eyes, grey eyes pocketed deep into the shadows beneath his lashes.
“I thought I hallucinated you,” Erwin said, thinking about their first meeting. First year of law school. Twenty-three. Levi had been seventeen. “You and Isabel.”
Erwin closed his eyes to the ruckus that his awakening caused and the pain that speaking gave him. Levi’s fingers were curled into his shoulder, perched on the side of the bed as he shouted for a passing doctor.
He was asleep again.
The next time he awoke, he felt slightly more alive, though his head was throbbing under the soft haze of medication. Levi was still beside him, which was strange, but he sucked on the water Levi gave him, room temperature from where it had been sitting. He complained of his sore throat and moved his hand to touch the outside of his jaw, his fingers catching on week-old stubble.
“They intubated you for a bit. That’s why it hurts,” Levi said. “They put you in a coma because of your head injury, but you’re okay. Apart from that blonde fucking head of yours, you didn’t break a bone. I was willing to break some when I found out you were here. It's been nearly a week.”
Erwin watched Levi’s face as he tried to take in his words. An accident. Erwin swallowed more of the water, holding the plastic cup close when Levi looked to take it from him. He was sitting very close to the edge of the bed. “Levi, what are you doing here?”
“You had an accident. T-boned five minutes from home. They had to cut you from the car.” Levi’s hand trailed to Erwin’s hairline, brushing back where his hair was falling over his eyes. Erwin moved his head out of his grasp. Levi’s concern was fine, but the touching… they didn’t do that. There were boundaries they couldn’t cross.
“Where’s Marie?” He asked, watching Levi’s face cloud with something strange for a moment. His hand moved from Erwin’s hairline, dropping to his lap. He seemed to shrink, growing smaller until he composed himself, sliding from the bed to the chair beside it.
“How should I know? At work probably.” Erwin stared down at Levi’s hands, at the gold band nudged onto his slender ring finger. He’d been single the last time they had spoken, single and—
“But—” Erwin started, trying to find words in his foggy mind. The last he remembered was going to work. The firm in California. A junior position had turned to senior, and with one of his bosses so close to retirement, he was so close to making partner. He’d kissed Marie goodbye in the kitchen, a promise to be home early for once. She had been despondent of late, and he’d wanted to cheer her up. “Levi, I haven’t seen you for two years. Why are you here?”
Levi stared at him, open-mouthed. He’d been a little firecracker when they had first met, quick to violence if he felt someone had wronged Erwin, but he’d calmed over the years, learned to behave himself mostly. Emotional, but only noticeable to those that knew him. Now, though, Levi’s fingers twisted in on themselves, and his voice was shaky when he spoke.
“I think maybe I should call a doctor.”
It might come back, the doctor said. Retrograde Amnesia because of the head trauma from the accident. No broken bones, some nasty bruises, and a stitched up cut across his forehead. Most of his bruises were already murky and healing, swaddled under the painkiller's haze.
“It’s rare,” the doctor said, hands shoved to the pockets of his white coat. Erwin felt a fraud, sitting in this bed with no broken bones. Levi was pale on the chair beside the bed, quiet since the doctor had agreed to see Erwin.
“I don’t suppose there’s any medication?” Erwin asked, but the doctor shook his head, looked down at his watch and made his excuses to leave.
That’s all he had to show for the fact that the last four years had withered away to nothing. Two years ago, he had reconnected with Levi, an old friend with an awkward history. They’d married eighteen months back. The ring on Levi’s finger was a wedding ring. It had three green emeralds embedded in the band. Erwin wore his on a chain around his neck. Levi told him all this as Erwin signed his discharge papers.
“So Marie and I broke up,” Erwin said, a sinking feeling in his chest. He had been with Marie since he was twenty-three. Married at twenty-six. Instead, it was Levi was helping him into a jacket. A blue windbreaker lined with a warm fleece. Erwin didn’t recognise it. It made the panic swell, but he swallowed it down, blamed his pallor on his nausea.
“Yeah.”
“Why?” Erwin pushed Levi’s hands away when he moved to do up the jacket. Erwin could do it. He wasn’t completely devoid of ability. His head ached. He wanted to brush his teeth with a whole tube of toothpaste, wanted to guzzle a gallon of mouthwash. Wanted to be left alone. Wanted mostly to sink back to what felt like yesterday to him, back to the life he had created for himself in San Francisco.
“That’s between the two of you,” Levi said — and when he noticed Erwin looking at him, he sighed, bunching his hands into his pocket. “You just didn’t work out.”
It was a slow walk from ward to the parking lot, but Erwin took his time. He would not take the wheelchair offered, and while his brain still felt sluggish, while his stomach twisted itself in knots about the unreality of his new reality, he persevered. Levi was quiet beside him.
“I remember this car,” Erwin said, once they had made it to the aforementioned vehicle. His head continued to ache, but the constant throb was a soothing distraction to the panic. The car smelled of pine from the tree dangling from the rearview mirror; polish from where Levi had cleaned the dashboard. Erwin breathed it in, watching the landscape change through the window. Painkillers rattled in the paper bag on his lap. He’d look through it at some point. They said there was unlikely to be any lasting damage, but he wasn’t to be alone for the next 48 hours. It would take time. He might recover some memories here and there. It might work out.
The car was an old Ford Escort. Levi had bought it with two years’ worth of tip-money from the diners he’d worked in and even then Erwin hadn’t been convinced it was worth it. The paintwork had been chipped, and it was more dented than smooth, but Levi had been proud of it for years. Now it had a paint job bringing it to a slick black, the dents beaten out of it. It had been a clunky drive on the few occasions Erwin had driven around in it, but it had been Levi’s baby. His second, less temperamental one.
“You never wanted to change it up?”
“If it works, I’m driving it,” Levi said. “It’s not had much action recently. You uh. Your car was better but—”
Levi had finished with a shrug, and Erwin didn’t respond. He was embarrassed and there was no argument to be had, anyway. He wondered what model he drove, whether it was salvageable from the crash. Back in San Francisco, he’d had a sporty Porsche that he drove, though he’d always been a little embarrassed by it.
They drove further out of the heavy traffic surrounding the hospital, past the university they had met at, when Levi had been cleaning lectures that Erwin was too advanced to take part in. They drove past where Erwin had his apartment with Mike and Hange back in the day, before they started their new lives.
They drove beyond the city limits until it evened out into a quieter neighbourhood with more trees and wider streets. He had a vague recollection as they drove through streets line with traditional row houses, the bottom floors opened up into storefronts. Levi had worked at a coffee shop along here once. He’d had an apartment above a florist’s and Isabel’s school had been only a few blocks away.
“This isn’t my home. I live in Lower Haight, San Francisco.” Erwin realised it the moment he vocalised it, and it sat tight in his chest, rattling just as much as his head throbbed beneath the cloud of pain meds he was doped up on.
“It’s our home,” Levi said, punctuating the second word. “We live in this neighbourhood.” Erwin’s palms itched and his scalp dampened with sweat as they drove through the streets.
“So I lost the house and my wife,” Erwin said. Something ached in his chest for the first time as reality set in, just to add to his foggy misery. Losing Marie, losing those Christmases tucked up in the alcove of their living room, the heady green tree losing its needles to the floor. The concrete slopes of the city they called home, so many miles away from the East Coast. “Now I’m back in a city I thought I’d left behind.”
“We live in a nice house,” Levi said defensively. Erwin looked over to see his shoulders had risen and stretched taut. His knuckles flexed white over the steering wheel. “It was my house. Mine and Izzy’s. You moved in when you came back.”
“Isabel.” Erwin suddenly remembered. How old was she when he last saw her? Thirteen or fourteen. “How is she?”
Levi settled down at the mention of his daughter. When he’d first met Levi, Isabel had been a little over four years old. A wild, red-haired creature with eyes too big for her face and a raucous spirit. Levi would sit her down in the corner with an old iPod and headphones while he cleaned lecture halls, or a quiet booth when he bussed tables. She’d been a cheerful thing, far more than her father had ever been.
“She’s at community college. She’s got an apartment with a friend, but she stays with us at the weekends so she can eat decent and so I’ll do her laundry. She’s eighteen. She’s… she’s really good.”
“That’s good,” Erwin said. He wondered if he was a good step-father, what kind of relationship they had. She used to call him Uncle Erwy when she was really little and he'd been almost disappointed when she dropped the diminutive form of his name as she grew older.
The house was a pale blue craftsman, small and far older than the modern condo he had lived in with Marie. The lawn was neatly trimmed, bordered with winter flowers. Levi pulled up into the double parking space and switched off the engine. It was a quiet street of similar houses; all modest, with junk and toys spilling over lawns and parking spaces. An old weathered lemonade stand from the summer sat in the yard of the house opposite.
“You lived the fancy life with Marie, but you like it here,” Levi said quietly. For the first time, he sounded stripped of confidence, almost nervous. “You always say you do.”
“Show it to me,” Erwin said. He didn’t smile, but he swallowed back his own nerves.
Every home of Levi’s was meticulously kept. From the little-more-than-a-bedsit when they first met, to the apartment above the florist he’d lived in. There’d been barely a sign of dust. The floors mopped, surfaces polished. Isabel’s toys held in boxes, stuffed teddies lined up over the made beds.
This wasn’t any different. The house was small but long; walls washed in a pale blue, the floors a dark wood. The living room held Erwin’s old leather couch, and his grandfather’s desk sat proudly in the tiny office. He must have brought those with him when he left Marie. Or when she left him. Or however they broke up.
The rest of it he didn’t recognise. Levi took him through to the kitchen at the far end of the house. It looked recently refurbished compared to the rest of the house. Heavy wood counters spreading from the walls, moving out into an island in the center of the room, three barstools tucked beneath it. A large coffee machine sat on the corner counter and that was Erwin’s, too, a joint wedding gift. Erwin remembered how Levi drank tea more than anything else. Coffee had always turned his stomach when he was serving bottomless brunches.
“Do you still work as a barista?” Erwin asked, embarrassed that he had to ask. He was married to a friend that, as far as he remembered, he hadn’t spoken to in going on two years. They hadn’t parted on good terms; it had been a needed clean break.
“I bought the owner out three years ago,” Levi said calmly, taking a seat at the kitchen table, nearing the window by the far side of the room. It was a butcher’s block, more expensive than almost anything else in the house he’d seen so far. “I came into some money, so I used it. Now it’s mine.”
“Oh.” That was good. Levi had worked nothing but menial jobs. He had the smarts, but not the money or time to do anything with it. Sometimes he used to read Erwin’s textbooks when he brought them round to study, unashamed to ask questions when words tripped him up. He’d read the daily news out loud and comment in his flat tone. He’d never got his GED going by what he’d told Erwin in the past. Between shitty foster homes and raising a kid, he’d been a little busy. “Congratulations.”
Levi stared at him from where he sat. His arms folded over his chest, his dark hair falling into his face. He looked tired. The three green stones embedded in his wedding ring sparkled in the bright afternoon light. Erwin felt dizzy. Too many revelations hitting him all at once.
“I want to take a shower,” Erwin said, when he realised the only word he wanted to say was sorry, knowing that would hardly go down well. “I don’t know where it is.”
Levi showed him without making a comment. Up the stairs was a small landing with three doors, one bathroom, Isabel’s room, and the master suite.
“We have an ensuite, but the water pressure’s shitty. Just to warn you.” Levi pointed to the open bedroom. Their bedroom. Erwin nodded his head, pleased when Levi moved away, walking back downstairs.
There was nothing much recognisable in the bedroom. If this had been Levi’s place prior to Erwin moving in, it must have been his bed and his furniture. It was as tidy as the rest of the place. The bedding folded and tucked. Erwin hadn’t been in here for nearly a week and Levi had barely left his side. He wondered if it had even been slept in.
His side of the bed - it must be his because there was the wedding photo of his parents, with his father’s wedding ring sitting alongside it. There was a train ticket, something he was certain Levi would have cleared out, but maybe he didn’t want to touch that side of the bed. Sentiment had always been strong with Levi.
Levi’s side had a picture of Isabel from before Erwin had met the two of them. She was round and fat with a scalp of fuzzy hair as she beamed at the camera, three teeth protruding through her pink gums. Behind it a photo of Levi and himself, wrapped up in scarfs and winter hats. Erwin was looking down at Levi, staring something fond at him. He felt uneasy looking at it.
Erwin took his shower, with water that trickled rather than streamed, but he still used the same shampoo. He liked that, the one familiar thing. He ran it through his hair, hissing when his fingers traced over the bruises hidden in his scalp. Erwin tried to keep his wound dry, but his skin itched where it had been sewn back together and the gauze grew damp.
He stared down at his body as the weak water bounced down from above. It looked like his, but fitter and a little more defined. He ran his thumb between where his abs rippled, felt the strength of his own obliques. He’d always been slim, but his time in his office, sitting in on litigations and settlements, had worn him down a little softer.
He laughed the first pure laugh of the day and wondered whether the meds were finally wearing off. Or maybe his now fit body was the only thing that hadn’t overwhelmed him or caused a well of sorrow in his chest.
As he finished the shower, he wrapped the towel around his waist and moved to the sink, wiping where the mirror had fogged with steam. He peered at his reflection, sunken and sallow. His forehead was bruised around where the skin had broken. He peeled off the old and damp gauze and stared at the thin, dark line of stitching running over the centre of his forehead. It would heal. It would leave a scar. If he didn’t like it, perhaps he would learn to leave his hair over his forehead, like Levi had always worn his. Levi. His former friend. His husband.
There were two toothbrushes sitting on the side of the basin. He stared for a moment before his fingers brushed the wet bristles of one. He grabbed the other and loaded it with toothpaste. Took three even breaths, hoping he wouldn’t vomit.
He didn’t. He brushed until his gums felt sore and red, and spat a foamy pink when finished, but he felt better for it. Felt more alive. Cleaner. He moved back into the bedroom, dropping the towel on the floor as he moved towards the closet.
It was easy to find his own clothes. Levi clearly laundered and folded everything, but the size difference was obvious. Erwin found sweats and a hoodie and pulled them both on. He ran a hand through his hair, squeezing the last of the water away. He pushed it back so it wouldn’t touch his cut forehead.
Erwin looked at his face in the mirror once the steam had dissipated. He needed to shave. He preferred a wet shave, an inclination that had followed him here, to Levi’s house, if the dark blue razor and shaving foam were anything to go by. Erwin scraped his stubble away and pressed his used towel to his face, feeling the tightening of his freshly shorn skin. That was better.
He looked like himself, maybe a little older in the lines creasing near his eyes, but not drastically so. His hair was longer than he recalled. He remembered Marie cutting his hair when it grew too long, how she ran her fingers across the nape of his neck, manicured nails digging in just slightly, just enough to make him shiver. She did that as she kissed him goodbye that morning. She looked beautiful as she did so, even with the sadness in her eyes.
He wanted to go home. Wanted to go back to his condo in Lower Haight, San Francisco with the woman he loved, and not the house he shared with his dear old friend. One of his best friends, until they’d chipped away at the fragile edges of their friendship. They hadn’t been like that. Erwin had refused it. On his father’s word, and then his own.
Levi’s lips were soft against his own. Erwin could taste them hidden as they were in a tiny linen closet, in the manor house that Mike and Nanaba’s wedding had taken place in. A beautiful wedding for a beautiful couple. Everyone was staying in the sprawling rooms on the top floor once the party was over. Erwin and Marie had flown in from the West Coast only the night before.
Levi tasted like the three mojitos he’d sucked down with Isabel sulking beside him at the table. She had been told off by a rather overprotective mother from the designated child’s table when caught trying to coax her ten-year-old son into flicking peas at another child. Isabel had since been demoted to the table where all of Mike’s friends from college had been placed.
Erwin tried to think of that and not about how Levi tasted like limes and mint, at how his hands were tight as they fisted at Erwin’s expensive shirt. They pressed up against each other, Erwin with his knees bent awkwardly and Levi on the tips of his toes, arms wound tight around Erwin’s neck, stopping him from going anywhere, stopping him from thinking about anything.
“I’ve always been yours, goddammit,” Levi was saying when they pulled apart for breath, continuing the argument that had followed them from the hired bar to the closet. His lips had swelled, flushed pink. Erwin’s must have been too. He pushed back Levi’s hair, tucked it behind his ears. Looked at his striking face, his intense eyes and pink cheeks. How beautiful he had grown.
Levi had been in a foul mood for most of the day, but he’d never done well in social situations, and having his parenting skills confronted publicly had been the final straw. Erwin had rarely heard him snap at Isabel, but he had when she’d been sent to sit beside him and in response she had crawled beneath the table and hadn’t ventured out since.
But then the food had been sent away, and everyone had moved from the formal tables to the dancefloor and bar in the room next door and what had been a kiss, a wrong kiss stolen beneath the haze of drink after a fight with his wife, suddenly felt worse. Levi had said words to Erwin he shouldn’t have in the awkward comfort he had tried to offer, after witnessing the argument.
Now Erwin stroked his hand down Levi’s face — he had such small features — Levi’s eyes shuttered close and he leant into the touch, his own fingers around Erwin’s wrist as he sighed against him.
“Don’t say that,” Erwin said, when their lips touched again. Levi’s eyes flickered open. His soft hair tickled Erwin’s cheeks where they touched. His shoulders ached from having to lean down so much, so Erwin stood to his normal height, breaking the distance. Levi’s fingers tightened around his wrist, but eventually he dropped from his toes, widening the gap between them. Dissipating the heady lust they were both drunk on.
“I’ve always been yours, why can’t you be mine?” Levi said, not quite babbling, but he was drunk and sad with it, flushed with kisses he had stolen when Erwin’s spirit was low and his wife pissed at him.
“Don’t say that,” Erwin repeated, using his free hand to prise Levi’s fingers from his wrist. Levi’s face dropped, hair falling over his forehead, hiding his expression. “Don’t say things like that, Levi.”
Erwin felt like a stranger walking back downstairs in his own house. He found Levi in the kitchen, sprawled at the small dining table beneath the window, his arm over the back of his chair, his hand cupped over his mug in that familiar little way of his. When he saw Erwin standing in the doorway, his eyes lingered for a moment before a small twitch of his lips.
“Feeling any better?”
“The shower helped. And shaving. And brushing the hell out of my teeth.”
“You taken a shit yet? That’ll help, I’m sure.”
“I’m not sure on what medical grounds,” Erwin said, falling into the seat beside Levi. “This is so disorientating.” He felt sick with it, like someone had plucked him from his world and placed into a new one. He felt like he was in a movie, a protagonist split in two. The Truman Show, or something else. “My last memory of you—”
“Mike’s wedding?” With Erwin’s sober nod, Levi shrugged. “Was about four years ago.” He was staring down at his mug, covered by his ringed hand.
“I rejected you,” Erwin said. With Levi’s taste in his mouth, he had turned him down; done the right thing. Gone back to his wife, despite the offer and the temptation before him.
“Not for the first time,” Levi inserted, firm but honest. “You wanted it. You fucking told me that yourself, so don’t deny it.”
“I did,” Erwin said, because he had. Levi had shown up in his usual black garb, smart enough for his usual fair but not formal. He’d worn black jeans and black boots and a tight black shirt, unbuttoned just enough that his collarbones were bare for everyone to see, no tie. Erwin’s heart had flipped at the sight.
Beside Levi, Isabel had worn a pink fluffy dress. It looked like a tutu. She wore black boots like Levi; the laces undone until he had told her to tighten them. At one point, he’d bent to do them himself, and Erwin had watched him tug the leather tight until she had whined playfully. They’d always been such a funny pair. Erwin remembered looking at the two of them among the rest of the wedding party, arm around Marie’s waist, aching to be a part of a family set-up like that. Of belonging somehow, but not knowing where. “But I wasn’t going to betray my wife. I wasn’t going to be the man that betrayed his wife at a wedding.”
Levi didn’t respond. He sipped his drink and didn’t look at Erwin. He had, of course, done exactly that the moment he’d pushed Levi into the linen closet.
“Levi, tell me what happened?”
“I don’t know the ins and outs,” Levi said eventually, placing his cup down on the saucer, fixing it until the bottom of the cup fit within the groove properly. Then he turned to look at Erwin. His face was serious and drawn, his lips down-turned, shadows deep around his eyes. “Erwin, your dad…”
It hit, not like a ton of bricks, but something heavy. He felt like he was drowning for a moment. His father had been sick for a long time, cancer taking its time poisoning his body in those last few years, but the last time he had seen him — no, the last time he remembered seeing him, he’d been good. They’d spent a long weekend together — the three of them — Erwin and Marie and his father. They’d driven to the coast, eaten lunch in a seaside restaurant, and walked to the front with the wind in their eyes. His father’s time was drawing to a close, but he hadn’t seemed so close to death that Erwin had been seriously worried.
“I’m sorry,” Levi said, his hand coming out to rest on Erwin’s. His hands were chilly, always had been, but the sensation was nice against his own heated skin, so he accepted it. “Please don’t cry.”
Erwin wasn’t a crier, and when he was, he did it where no one would see. Not even Marie, who cried at the hint of an injured dog in a commercial, had ever seen him blub. Erwin lifted his hand to his cheek and realised it was wet. He sniffed, wiped them away with the back of his hand. Then he sniffed harder and swallowed down.
“How did he go?”
“In his house. He had nurses… I visited when I could,” Levi said quietly. “When I knew it was nearing the end, I called you so you could say goodbye to him. He went in his sleep with you beside him. You had him cremated. You visit his grave whenever you’re back home. I don’t go with you. You like to be alone.”
“That’s good.” Erwin couldn’t recall. Couldn’t recall the nurses, or his father’s death; of visiting his grave. Though if he was with his mother, he at least knew where to find him. “I’m glad he went peacefully.”
“Yeah.”
There was a pause. Erwin was no longer crying, though the headache had doubled. He thought he ought to take another dose of painkillers, but the pain at least distracted him from the panic.
“That doesn’t explain how I ended up with a husband instead of my wife,” Erwin said, pressing his fingers to the puffy spots beneath each eye. “Forgive me. I’m not trying to be cruel. I just don’t understand.”
“Yeah, I know you’re not,” Levi said quietly. His own hands were busy in his lap, folded neatly over each other, the rest of his tea forgotten to the table. “You and Marie, I don’t know. Maybe you wanted different shit. I wasn’t there. I wasn’t a part of that. We weren’t talking, but your dad was more important than any of that. It was easy for me to take care of him when I lived in the same city. He’d always been kind to me and Izzy. Bought her shit for Christmas every year.”
“I didn’t know that.”
“I think he felt sorry for me,” Levi said, shrugging his shoulder. “Whatever. I got in contact with you, and you weren’t doing too good. You and Marie separated about the same time and well, you’re noble and shit, so you let her have the house and you stayed with me.”
“Did I cheat on her with you?”
“Outside of Mike and Nana’s wedding?” Levi asked, and there was a little flame behind the words, but Erwin didn’t ignite it further. “No… you slept on my couch for a few months and then we… you know, it just… because I wasn’t lying that night at the wedding, but we just. And we got together.”
“How strange,” Erwin said. He closed his eyes and tried to picture it. A broken marriage, a divorce, a dead father and a new marriage to a longtime friend. All of it gone and none of it was coming back.
“It didn’t seem strange when we lived it,” Levi said. “You must be hungry. I’ll cook something. You’re a real ugly crier, Erwin.”
“I know.” That made him laugh. Levi was true to himself, the way he spoke, the kindness wrapped around barbed-truths that he was never much good at softening. Erwin wasn’t all that hungry, nauseas more than anything else, but he didn’t comment. He sat at the table with Levi’s half-drunk tea, and watched him putter around the room, pulling ingredients from the refrigerator and cupboard that Erwin didn’t remember.
Odd, he thought, maybe he had been the one to purchase the onions Levi was chopping, maybe this was something he liked to eat. Did Levi do most of the cooking? Marie had, mostly because Erwin was such a poor cook he’d once overcooked spaghetti for her once during a romantic date night in. It hadn’t mattered because he had kissed her and held her to him, and their mouths had tasted rich, of the merlot they had poured down their necks to drain out the burned pasta sauce.
Two bowls of ramen were placed on the table in no time. This he remembered. When he’d been a poor college student with a nasty head cold, Levi had come around to the apartment he shared with Mike and cooked the same bowl of store-cupboard ramen. Erwin had eaten it with a comforter around his shoulders as Levi sat on the couch with Isabel asleep in his lap, reading one of Erwin’s textbooks.
“Cheap-ass chicken soup for the goddamn soul,” Erwin said, flattening his tone in a mockery of Levi. His voice had been a little higher back then, but flattened deliberately.
“You remember?” Levi said, laughing along.
“Yeah,” Erwin said, not reminding Levi that he’d only lost four years, not fourteen. “Yeah, I remember.”
Chapter 2
Glitter
“Oh Levi, hello.”
Erwin and Mike had made a pit-stop at a local diner that sold potent black coffee and cheesy grits — the grits were for Mike. It was the only diner that sold them worthy of a second go. Erwin had never dared touch them, despite Mike’s insistence they were the best thing to make it out of the south.
As Levi placed the food down in front of Mike, he stilled for a moment before turning his face toward Erwin. He was in a black t-shirt with the diner’s logo on the front, the short sleeves rolled several times so they sat above his elbows, an apron around his waist.
“Erwin. You’re awake this time?”
“You guys know each other?” Mike asked with a frown, adjusting his fork.
“Levi found me asleep after a lecture,” Erwin admitted. He turned to Levi and smiled, though it wasn’t returned.
“You in law school too?” Mike asked. He knew all of Erwin’s friends and had a charming protective streak as if he needed to vet every one that walked into his path. Erwin, thankfully, had only a select group of people he would call friends. It made it easier.
“Do I look like I’m in law school?” Levi looked to the two of them. Mike looked at him like he expected some more detail, but Levi wasn’t forthcoming.
“Hey, how’s Isabel?” Erwin asked, as he moved to step away. “Cute gremlin, by the way. I don’t think I mentioned before.”
“Fine.” Levi grabbed the menus still resting on the table and stepped back. It was less that he seemed unfriendly, but rather passionately awkward. His eyes didn’t meet Erwin’s, but skirted his own feet. “Enjoy your meal.”
“Who’s Isabel?” Mike asked when Levi had left. Erwin watched him for a moment, moving to place the menus on the counter before sliding over to another table. He was very watchable, Erwin decided.
“His daughter. She’s three or four.”
“Christ.” Mike said, but when Erwin’s glare caught, he simply shrugged. “Looks like a kid himself.”
Mike was easy to sway into going back to the diner, if not for the cheesy grits but the fact that he could sit there and people watch, Mike enjoyed doing that, liked that it was a midway point between work and home, and he liked the food. Erwin liked the refillable coffee, the cleanliness of the tables, and that Levi worked there. That it wasn’t far from campus.
Sometimes he showed up on his own, textbooks spread out in front of him. The booths by the window were large, so that he could spread his books easily and still have space for coffee and a slice of pie.
“Remember me?” He jolted up to the sound of a little girl’s voice and rubbed at his eyes, tired but somehow relieved for the break from studying. He’d needed a distraction.
“Isabel,” Erwin said, smiling at her. “Do you work here?”
She laughed, her small face scrunching up. “No, silly! Daddy works here so I have to be quiet and behave myself.”
“Are you doing that right now?” Her face dropped in shock at Levi’s words. He was standing at the table awkwardly. It was the last evening lull, with a sporadic selection of patrons. At this time of the day, people were at home or eating food in proper restaurants.
“I’m being good!” She insisted, and Erwin couldn’t help but imagine she had used the phrase countless times before. Levi held his hand out for his daughter, but Erwin interrupted, told him to sit if he could. Levi looked at his watch, muttered something about taking a quick break, and slid into the booth beside his daughter.
“Is this all you do? Fall asleep over textbooks?” Levi asked quietly. Erwin laughed, closing the book in front of him. He really should head back home soon, only Mike was having a friend over which was vague terms for Erwin to get the fuck out until he was finished. Hange was experimenting with their science buddy Moblit, which Erwin hadn’t asked details about, but usually meant they’d be gone for days at a time.
“It’s not all I do.”
Levi’s eyes dropped to the pile of textbooks. “You want to be a lawyer?”
“Not really.” There was something about Levi that made it easy to admit - easier than his father, who had got out years ago and ran his little antique business, but the family business beckoned and needed a figurehead. At least his uncle said so. “I want to teach law academically, I think.”
“You wanna teach law?”
“I think I would be good at it. I come from a family of lawyers, I'm well prepped. Poli-sci background; interned at my family's company. They want me to join them. I’ve done quite a lot of tutoring, which I really like.”
“What kind of law firm does your family run?”
“Corporate law.”
“So useless if I got arrested?”
“Are you planning on that?”
“Better to be prepared in all circumstances,” Levi said. Isabel had slumped on top of him and he was stroking back her hair absentmindedly. He was staring at Erwin intently, grey eyes unblinking.
“You don’t think it’s a foolish idea?”
“I don’t know you enough to know if it’s foolish,” Levi said, but he was sliding from the booth now, his break over. He beckoned to Isabel but she slouched low in her chair and Erwin batted a hand, unbothered.
“It’s alright, she can stay.”
They saw each other more after that. Erwin found out Levi’s schedule because he asked for it, and Levi only called him half a creep, but there was an almost lightness in his tone that suggested he was joking. He would join Erwin on quick breaks, ask him questions about his degree, about his work, chide him for not sleeping enough, complain about the dark circles under his eyes, but fill Erwin’s mug with black-tar coffee whenever he passed.
It became routine after that. Levi pretended Erwin annoyed him, would snap if he asked too many questions and wouldn’t always let Isabel sit with him even if she pleaded, but there was an easiness there: a kindness. Sometimes, Erwin would wait until Levi’s shift was over and walk him and Isabel to the bus stop. If she was asleep, he’d carry her. They became friends in those quiet moments.
He didn’t see Levi again on campus, and after a while, he realised he hadn’t worked there for some time. When he eventually asked, Levi just shrugged at him.
“Bussing tables is more lucrative,” Levi said, irony rich in his flat tones. “She’s in pre-k so I can work more in the day. Was harder to work that around the cleaning jobs.”
Erwin left it at that. He didn’t wish to pry into Levi’s life anymore than the few slips of information he was granted. He tipped but not excessively so, because he didn’t want Levi to think he thought him a charity case.
“I have, like, this social worker,” Levi said one evening as they walked to the bus stop. Isabel was clutching onto Levi’s hand, carefully making sure to not step on any cracks in the sidewalk and muttering away to herself.
“I didn’t know that.”
“It’s not because I can’t take care of my kid,” Levi said defensively. “‘Cause of how I grew up and ‘cause I had her young. She’ll fuck off in a few months when I’m eighteen, but she won’t leave me the fuck alone about going to this group thing. Sort of obliged. For kids like me.”
“Teenage parents?” Erwin asked, frowning when Levi breathed out a laugh.
“No, the uh, other thing. If I go, it’ll look good. She says I need to find people that are part of the community. Do you think —” he said and then stopped. “It’s only Tuesdays at six. Couple of hours.”
“Perhaps I could look after Isabel?” Erwin suggested when Levi could not continue.
“I’ll pay you or whatever,” Levi said, but Erwin shook his head.
It was a tiny little apartment, wedged between other apartments in a not great but not deplorable side of town. Levi made vague comments about his social worker finding housing for him before he shrugged it off. Levi didn’t enjoy talking about that side of his life, and Erwin didn’t press. It was one room, with a bed behind a curtain in a small alcove, a tiny box room with a small single bed, and bathroom.
The box room was painted yellow, and the bedding was purple, stuffed toys lined up neatly over the bed. There wasn’t much in the way of furniture; a little kitchenette, a plastic table and chairs, a small couch and TV set. On the floor by the tv was a row of Disney films, piled in neat alphabetical order.
“I get em from thrift stores,” Levi said, “but she only really likes The Little Mermaid, so you’ll have to watch that.”
“They have the same hair colour,” Erwin said, remembering the colour, the purple bra, and little else.
“Yeah, that’s what I said, and it stuck.”
Isabel was self-sufficient for almost-four. Or just bossy, and Erwin quite liked that. Levi had already bathed her and dressed her in her green pyjamas before Erwin had arrived, but she still looked bright eyed and wide awake. He’d bought his textbooks, but she had pulled him over to the couch with a small hand and pushed him down with her stuffed bunny and plastic mermaid doll with the emergency haircut Levi had given it when she’d dropped her head-first into a bowl of oatmeal last week.
Eventually she fell asleep halfway through the second showing and he carried her to the little box room where she sprawled, mouth open and undisturbed. He sat at the kitchen table, opened his book, just as Levi’s key turned in the lock.
He closed the book and smiled. Levi looked around as if expecting a bomb to have gone off and then shrugged. “You left the TV on.”
“Sorry.”
“It’s okay.”
“How was the meeting?”
“It was okay.” He paused, took a seat, and then laid his hands flat on the table. “Weird. I don’t know. They all seem so young.”
Levi was young, though it was hard to remember that at times. “In what way?”
“They just — just because we’re all you know,” Levi waved his hand up the length of his body — “Doesn’t mean I can identify with any of them. None of them have it easy, but none of them have kids. They don’t — I don’t have time to think about the shit they want to talk about.” Levi paused again and looked over at Erwin. His face had turned a little pink and his mouth flattened further. “Sorry you don’t need to hear this.”
“I don’t mind. It’s interesting, you’re interesting.”
Levi’s eyebrows rose. “A freak show?”
“Hardly.”
It became a routine. The more Levi went to his group, the less uneasy he was about it and Erwin enjoyed Tuesdays with Isabel; whether it was sitting down to watch The Little Mermaid on repeat or playing games she made up. Even the time she’d been sick enough to just sit quietly on the couch, where Erwin could actually study for once, had been good.
“What was today’s discussion?” Erwin asked every time. Now he’d learned that Levi liked tea, he always had a pot waiting for him, steaming on the small plastic table. Levi grumbled every time, because Erwin was apparently useless at making it, but the thanks came in the small tilt of his head every time he sat beside him, small hands folding over the cheap mug.
“To pack or not to pack. It got heated.” Erwin didn’t know what that meant, didn’t think he needed to know. He’d decided early on that if Levi didn’t implicitly tell him, then he would not ask. There was a lot he could fill in without a word spoken.
“You know,” Mike said, when Erwin came home a month after his babysitting sessions began. He was happy, even if the route to Levi’s was two buses and a decent ten-minute walk. “It’s weird. You get that, don’t you?”
“Know what?” Erwin asked, putting his rucksack down by the floor. Hange was snoring in the chair, head bowed, glasses pushed up onto their hair. “You just gonna let them sleep like that?”
“They like it,” Mike shrugged. “I meant you and the little grouch. You’re not his kid’s dad, don’t act like it.”
Erwin laughed because the concern was sincere on Mike’s face and he really thought Levi was the sort to take advantage. He wanted for them to meet properly, so they could become friends too.
++++
“If you’re more comfortable, I can sleep on the couch,” Levi said that night. They were both upstairs early, but Erwin was tired and aching where the bruises had worn him down, where the anxiety had eaten away at him. He sat on the bed, their bed, in pyjamas Levi had fetched for him because he wasn’t sure where to find them.
“No,” Erwin said. They had slept near each other before and anyway, they were married and Erwin had always loved Levi, so it was fine. Still, even after agreeing, his stomach felt knotted. Felt shitty because he couldn’t help but think he’d be soothed by the sight of Marie, her long dark hair falling over her shoulders as she brushed it, in those silk pyjamas she wore that hugged her curves. She’d laugh and press her soft lips to his forehead, stroke her hand through his hair.
Erwin climbed onto the bed. He could smell his own shampoo on the pillow, just above the scent of laundry. He turned his head to the open door of the bathroom and saw how Levi was hunched over the sink, toothbrush in his hand, dressed in a large black t-shirt and boxers. His other hand gripped the basin so harshly Erwin could see how his knuckles had whitened. He spat, rinsed with mouthwash and splashed water on his face.
Erwin tried to smile when Levi climbed into the bed beside him, but he didn’t return it. Levi laid with his head down on the pillow, just enough space between them that it felt purposeful and a little awkward. They’d slept in the same bed before, in that tiny little box apartment, in that slither in time where they had been more than friends. Back then, Levi had curled up against his chest, head tucked beneath Erwin’s chin. Now he wasn’t so sure what it was like.
Levi didn’t move. He stared straight up, arms crossed over his chest, and Erwin stared at his profile. He had a little snub of a nose, a small mouth, hair impossibly dark. Feline, with sharp teeth and pointed features. Beautiful, always so damn beautiful to Erwin.
“Goodnight, Erwin.” Levi leaned over, flickered off the lamp beside him so the room was stripped of light. They laid in the bed together, and Erwin waited until his eyes adjusted slightly, until the shadowy furniture in the room popped up three-dimensional and eerie. He could hear Levi breathing lightly beside him, silent and dead-still.
“Goodnight Levi.”
Erwin slept until a distant sound woke him up with a start. It pulled him from the fog of nothingness; of dreams that he couldn’t recall, and his breath caught in his chest and at the base of his throat. He felt disorientated, couldn’t work out where he was, why his mattress felt too firm, why he couldn’t feel the silk of Marie’s pyjamas in his grasp.
“S’the neighbour’s car alarm. Always goes off,” Levi’s voice pulled through from behind Erwin. They had rolled the same way in the night, and his hand was small in the centre of his back, rubbing in circles.
Then Erwin remembered. He didn’t live with his wife anymore. They were divorced, and he was with his friend now. His friend who he had loved and left once, who had kissed him at their mutual friend’s wedding, who he had walked away from again.
Levi’s hand slipped down and circled around Erwin’s waist until he was wriggling closer, curled up behind him, nose pushed between shoulder blades. His feet were cold, pressing to Erwin’s calves, but Erwin didn’t fight it, did nothing but close his eyes and wait for the wash of sleep.
Erwin felt rough the next morning. Aching in the places that were still bruised, his head throbbing. He blinked, rubbed at his eyes, winced at the bruise over his temple. He turned to his side in the unfamiliar room and noticed that the bed was empty beside him.
The room span as he stood up, but not enough to worry him. He just stood, grasping awkwardly at the headboard with his eyes closed until it passed. He showered much as he had the day before; using too much shampoo purely because the scent was one of the few familiar things to him. He brushed his teeth, changed into clothes that fit him tight across the chest. He’d lived in his Hugo Boss suits before, when he moved from meeting to meeting to meeting. He touched his fingers to the chained ring sitting around his neck, rubbing over it lightly beneath his clothes.
Erwin was drinking coffee at the kitchen table when Levi burst through the front door. From his place at the table, he had a direct viewpoint through the hall and watched how Levi toed off his running shoes and slid them onto the neat shoe rack just beneath the coat hooks, before walking into the kitchen.
He was in shorts and a long sleeve gym shirt. Wired earbuds tucked into his shirt. His hair was damp at the ends, and his cheeks flushed from his run.
“Hi,” he said eventually, moving into the kitchen and filling a glass with water. He wiped at his mouth when he caught Erwin staring, his forehead creasing. He was beautiful, enough that Erwin’s breath caught in his chest for a few deep seconds. “Do you remember anything?”
Erwin shook his head, moved his eyes away, so he didn’t have to think about analysing whatever expression would appear on Levi’s face. “Do I run normally? I’m fitter than I remember.”
“No, you don’t run,” Levi said, with a lightness of tone. There must be an anecdote there, but he didn’t expand. “Mike suckered you into CrossFit after you came back. You hated it, but you still work out with him. Do you want me to call him?”
“No, I think I’d like a few days to just—” acclimatise was on the top of his tongue, but he was too exhausted to say it. He sighed, face falling in his hands, hair damp and cooling on his collar.
“Okay. I’m going to take a shower,” Levi said, and Erwin nodded at the brisk sensation of Levi leaving the room.
Erwin took his painkillers with a banana he found in the fruit basket and the rest of Levi’s glass of water. He finished his coffee, grateful that he still bought the same brand. Every time something familiar showed up, this new life felt a little bit more real to him.
While Levi showered, he moved into the living area. It was cosy and Erwin discovered more of his things. A floor to ceiling bookshelf; old textbooks from school that he hadn’t been able to clear out. Mainly his father’s collection; old history books from decades before his birth, heavy tomes and anthologies he’d snagged here and there, and that his father hadn’t been able to part with. He ran his fingers along the length of their spines, remembered how they looked in his office, in his old house, remembered his grandfather’s desk and wondering how let down the rest of his family had felt about him not joining the firm right away.
Levi came into the room just as he pulled out an old edition of Dante’s Inferno. The story was one he had studied in school, had grown accustomed to referencing through the years, but this edition had been his first exposure to it and the illustrations had horrified him as a child.
“I think I would like to see my father,” Erwin said. Levi was standing beside him, slate eyes turned toward him as he held out a steaming mug of tea. Erwin took it from him and breathed in the bitter scent of green tea. “The house and where he’s buried.”
“Sure. We can drive up at the weekend,” Levi said levelly. He sat down on the couch, hands cupped around his own mug as he folded his legs beneath himself.
“What day is it now?” Erwin asked, embarrassed. He must have known. Yesterday had been a blur of grief and confusion.
“Thursday. I have — Isabel has a game tomorrow. We always go to that but we can leave after, or Saturday morning.”
“Saturday is fine.” Erwin moved from the bookcase, stepped around the low coffee table. There were three coasters evenly spread around it and he placed his mug on it and then took a seat beside Levi. The pills were kicking in. He could feel them dulling the headache slightly. He hoped that when it stopped, his memories would come back. So that he could feel something and Levi would stop looking at him quiet so cautiously. “I do feel like part of me knew about my father. The grief feels old and worn in. It must have been worse before.”
“I think you’ve got a lot you’re dealing with,” Levi said. “But maybe. I don’t know how it works. I tried reading shit online, but I’m too dumb to comprehend what it all means.”
“You’re not dumb,” Erwin said, and the words sounded familiar in his mouth. He remembered using them before. Levi had a tendency to ridicule himself if he felt out of his depths. “It might come back. I might remember flashes.”
“Yeah.”
“Levi, what about work?” His plan had been to stay for a few more years in San Francisco, make partner and allow his family to perhaps forget about him, or maybe they would expect him back, perhaps he would allow himself to be bought out and move back to the East Coast, fall into line in a way his father hadn’t been able to.
“Don’t focus on that right now. You don’t work for any firm at the moment. You’ve got your father’s store that you- you spend a lot of time there. It runs itself. Little Blondie runs it and calls you when he gets into trouble.”
“You’re going to have to be more specific,” Erwin said, but felt settled. HIs five-year plan had gone, the pressures left behind and the discontent forgotten about. He wondered whether he even made Partner; did he care?
“Armin. Old man Artlet’s grandson. He looks after the store for you day in and out. You mostly hang out there when I piss you off.” Levi’s words drifted off and Erwin didn’t catch a memory, but more a feeling; a warmth in his chest at the sensation. The intimacy. “He’s a good kid, I guess.”
“And I’m happier doing that?”
“You always said you were. You write a lot — articles for journals. We do alright financially. Not like before, with you and Marie. Or we did before the accident. I guess we gotta see what your insurance said.”
“Was it my fault?”
“No, you were t-boned by a drunk motherfucker, but you know, medical bills. It’s fine. We can cover it,” Levi said. He nodded his head determinedly. He’d lived above the poverty line, dipped beneath it several times. “It doesn’t matter because you’re here.”
The rest of the day slipped away from Erwin slowly. He found peace in flicking through Dante’s Inferno while he listened to Levi clean the house and talk gruffly on the phone. The images that had once terrified him were now just familiar reminders of a past. A comfort.
Erwin blinked back to reality with the unsettled understanding that he would never see his father again. The grief felt aged, as if life had moved around it, a more gnarled scar than a fresh wound.
“Fuck it, Izzy. Just do as you’re damn told. It’s just Saturday, you do this for me and you can have the rest of the week off.” Levi wandered into the room, cussing into his phone. “Nah, I won’t be fuckin’ paying you double. Just make sure Furlan’s with you.”
Erwin listened to the half-hearted argument until Levi hung up, looking over at Erwin with a frown as he slipped his phone into his pocket. “Isabel’s gonna cover Saturday so we can go up to your dad’s.”
“Is his house still there?”
“Yeah, you haven’t sold it yet.”
“That was my plan? To sell it?”
“That’s what you said.” Levi offered him nothing else, so Erwin simply nodded.
“I would like to see it.”
“Yeah.” Levi took a seat beside him on the couch, the furthest side, as if he was worried that sitting too close it would send Erwin into a panic. It wouldn’t. They’d always been close. Levi had never been touchy, but even from the early days of their friendship, there’d been an easy feeling between the two of them.
The rest of the day moved quickly, even if Erwin didn’t. He felt sluggish in his movements. Between painkillers dulling the headache, the rest of his body ached. The caffeine from that morning could only do so much to revive any clarity, but when Levi asked if he wanted to take a drive out through the neighbourhood to familiarise himself, he agreed quickly.
He sat in the passenger seat as Levi drove slowly through the neighbourhood, eyes fixed on the road. It was pretty in that makeshift way, not as affluent as where Erwin had grown up, or even in Lower Haight. Here lawns were littered with toys, weathered and broken, but as they passed, neighbours waved when they saw them, looking relieved in particular to see Erwin. He’d admittedly handed his phone back to Levi when he’d given it to him in the day, aware of the messages that would await him, half from people he had no recollection of.
“I wish I could tell you I remember,” Erwin said when they pulled up onto a strip of shops. An Italian chain restaurant, an electronic store and a Target behind it.
“You love the garlic bread in that place,” Levi said, face blank even if his shoulder deflated. He thumbed toward the Italian restaurant. “You’d eat a basket of that shit. Disgusting.”
“That sounds excessive.”
“You shouldn’t eat that many carbs at once,” Levi told him, and he was losing himself, Erwin could see, to memories that only one of them could remember.
“I’d like to visit your coffee shop tomorrow,” Erwin said, wondered whether that would trigger anything. He knew the building vaguely. Levi had worked there on and off, depending on how well he got on with the management.
“It’s a tea shop,” Levi reminded him, “Some coffee because that shit sells, but mostly tea.”
“Isabel works there?” Erwin asked, and Levi nodded.
“Yeah, most weekends, unless she has a game. She has a game so we’ll — she has a game, but she’s agreed to cover.”
Yes, Erwin remembered Levi mentioning that earlier, but hadn’t really picked up the context. “Game?”
“Roller-Derby. She joined when she was sixteen but they’re really good, best in the damn county, as far as I can tell. Izzy’s uh—” Levi paused, used his thumb to rub against his nose before he turned the car on again. “She’ll be at home when we get back. She wanted to see you. Last time you were in the hospital with the tubes, you know? Freaked her out.”
Erwin thought of Isabel at her youngest, her chubby cheeks, wild hair and green pajamas as she insisted they watch The Little Mermaid again.
“I want to see her too.”
Isabel was already in the house by the time Levi pulled into the driveway. The door was open ajar and Levi clicked his tongue, turned to Erwin and told him she hadn’t ever really changed.
Isabel wore a silver spandex catsuit, a pale pink jacket made of faux fur and black combat boots with enough of a chunky heel that they brought her up to Levi’s height. Her hair was pulled into the two pigtails he remembered her favouring as a toddler, but she had streaks of gold glitter in it - purposeful Erwin presumed - in how it ran in thick streaks either side of her parted pigtails. The glitter flickered in the kitchen's light. Her tongue was stained purple from the Kool Aid she had grasped in her hand as she opened her mouth, although Levi spoke first.
“Tch. You look like all the worst parts of the seventies threw up on you,” Levi told her, staring mostly at her fuzzy cardigan with untethered disgust.
“The best parts,” she corrected and turned her attention to Erwin instead, who didn’t disagree with her statement. It was just a lot. “Hey Pops. How’s the head? Remember who I am?”
He froze and then laughed. Levi was stiff beside him, but Isabel’s nose scrunched up. She was using a switchblade to pick at the grime under her lilac painted nails, and she smelled like cotton candy and weed. As she smiled, he could see that her teeth were a little crooked from where Levi hadn’t been able to afford to get them corrected.
“She doesn’t call you pops. She’s just being an asshole,” Levi said quietly, as Erwin slipped into the seat beside her.
“Well, I was hardly gonna continue calling you uncle when you started fu—” Isabel stopped and raised her palms upwards in defence. He hadn’t caught sight of Levi’s face, but that she stopped was enough. Already he felt a little calmed by her presence, as eccentric as it was. Levi left the room, after snatching the switchblade from Isabel, and Erwin listened to the soft sound of his footsteps moving up the stairs before he looked over at her again.
“Do you remember those few times we did Christmas at my father’s?” Erwin asked her, remembering how different he had found it at first. Before, it had been just his father and decrepit old family members he saw once a year. It was a lot more fun with Levi and Isabel, or that first year had been. Levi had never raised her to believe in Father Christmas, but she’d bought into it at his own father’s insistence. His dad had liked it too, having an exuberant child around the place, more playful that Erwin had ever been with his books and serious conversation.
“He was the best fake grandad ever,” she said. “Did you ever meet Uncle Kenny? He stayed with us for six months a few years back before he died. He was like the opposite of your dad, always made me think back to those Christmases.”
Erwin had tried to put that second Christmas behind him. Levi had never wanted to come — not after Erwin had stalled things between them — and Marie had come at his father’s insistence. He’d felt cruel at the time for forcing the two of them to meet so reluctantly. Now he just felt a coward.
“I never met Kenny,” Erwin cleared his throat, fading from his memory and finally answering Isabel. “I heard stories.”
“I think he was probably a piece of shit to dad, but they loved each other, you know? In that way that looks like hate on the outside.”
“Perhaps.”
Levi came back into the room, so Erwin didn’t reply further. Levi looked suspiciously between the two of them, before wrinkling his nose up at Isabel.
“Your perfume is disgusting and doesn’t hide the grass underneath.” Levi touched his fingers to Isabel’s glittering scalp and frowned when his fingers sparkled with gold. “Are you staying here tonight?”
“Yeah, I’m gonna be here tonight. Furlan’s studying.” There was a crook to her eyebrows that suggested studying meant something else entirely, and an almost smirk on Levi’s face to suggest he knew the implications, too.
Levi cooked dinner for them all, sticky rice with a beef stew, while Isabel smoked on the decking outside and Erwin sat in the chair in the kitchen, following Levi’s movements with his eyes, finding comfort in the familiar gracefulness of his movements; the fluidity.
“What’s she studying?”
“Special effects makeup or something. She spends a lot of time making people look gruesome. I think she’s good at it. Not sure there’s much of a career in it. Not this side of the country.”
“Is she still into The Little Mermaid?”
Levi barked out a short laugh, and his eyes caught Erwin’s over the table. “Yeah, she fucking is.”
They ate around the small square table. They probably did this a week ago. Perhaps Isabel showed them some gruesome body art she was working on; a prosthetic wound or maybe just glittery hair like she had right now, and Levi would make some foul comment about it and Erwin would laugh it off, try to mediate, and they’d be like a family. Dysfunctional, maybe, but good
Erwin went to bed early that night after insisting on washing the dishes, although he was at a loss to where everything went. He stacked them on the counter and watched where Levi placed them, wanting desperately to apologise for his ineptness, but knowing sorry had never gone down all that well with Levi.
Levi and Isabel had spent no time together since Erwin had come home and he presumed they must have something to say. Maybe now Isabel was older; an adult by all intents and purposes, maybe she could comfort her father. He needed it, no doubt.
Through the floor, he could hear Isabel's voice trilling upwards, punctuating her words with a giggling cackle every so often. Erwin laid in a bed, with the mixed scents of himself and his old friend, and fell asleep early, only stirring a few hours later to the feel of Levi climbing into the bed beside him.
Perhaps it was memory muscle that had Erwin stirring in the early hours, rolling onto his side and curling up behind Levi, filling his arms with him. When he awoke properly a few hours later, he still had his face buried in the back of Levi’s neck. The rest of him pressed up warm against his chest.
There was a calmness he felt, with his arms wrapped around him. Levi was stroking his knuckles, where his hand rested lightly on his cheek, cupping him close. Then the gentle press of Levi’s lips against his palm, in the centre where it tickled the most.
“Good morning,” Erwin said, voice rough with lack of use. He pressed his nose to the heat of Levi’s nape, breathing in the scent of soap and sleep.
“Morning.” Levi said nothing else, and didn’t move either. They laid entwined together, curled up in their bed, their second night together as a married couple for all that Erwin remembered. There were, he supposed, many more memories running through Levi’s mind.
Eventually Levi pulled away, threw back the covers and started toward the bathroom. Erwin sighed, rolled his palm down over the warm sheet, flush where Levi’s body had been. As the bathroom door clicked shut, he rolled onto his back, pulling his hand up from the bed.
It was glistening with blood, dark and clotting, coating his palm, and dripping down his wrist. He jerked upright, ripped the covers back, terrified at what he’d find there, but nothing. He stared at his hand; it was clean. No blood.
“I think I had a flashback,” Erwin’s voice was shaking when Levi opened the bathroom door a few minutes later with his head in his hands, sitting on the edge of the unmade bed. He lifted his head to watch Levi pull running shorts and another long-sleeve gym shirt from the closet, putting them on over fresh underwear as he waited for Erwin to continue. “But it was odd. There was blood on the bed. I put my hand in it.”
Levi tightened the drawstring around his waist, eyes sliding to the bed, where the bottom sheet was revealed. The sheets were white, crumpled, but clean with it. An indent in the middle where they’d slept curled around each other.
“You’ve just had a brain injury. There’s no blood.”
Erwin swallowed. “No, there’s not. I just wondered-”
“You have a checkup next Tuesday. Maybe tell your doctor if you see anymore,” Levi said, moving to unclip his phone from where it was charging on the nightstand. “I’m going for a run. I’ll be back in twenty minutes. Then I’ve got to open up.”
Erwin had his morning shower, staring down at his newfound abs and latently knew that he ought to call up Mike. They worked out together, apparently. They’d played squash in college, a little soccer here and there. Mike had opened his own gym years back, and it had been a success. Erwin remembered the opening night celebrations.
He still fixated on the blood. It had only been two seconds at most, but it had felt real — genuine enough to panic. Levi was probably right, it was just his brain playing tricks on him. Maybe he was mixing up a flashback with the car wreck. The wound on his forehead had bled excessively. Perhaps he had touched it in the cloudy moments of consciousness in the crumpled womb of his car.
Erwin made coffee, and ate a large bowl of cereal before Levi came back, skin-pink and hair damp with sweat, just as he had the day before. This time he didn’t speak to Erwin, but headed past him. Erwin didn’t take it to heart, Levi had never been a man of many words.
Ten minutes later, Levi was back downstairs, dressed in dark jeans and a grey sweater, his hair still damp from a shower. Erwin’s eyes dropped to the ring on his finger, the one he put there. He wished he remembered. There was a thud from directly above them.
“Isabel just fell off the bed again,” Levi said with his eyes lifted to the ceiling, as if this was a regular occurrence. “She needed to wake up anyway. Are you coming or what?”
“To work with you?”
“I thought it might be good,” Levi shrugged, his arms folded over his chest. “Not saying you’ll remember anything, but you’ve spent a lot of time there. And you need to get out.”
“Yes. Let’s go.”
Erwin poured the rest of his coffee into a thermos he saw on the open shelf in the kitchen, smiled through Levi berating him because they were going to a tea shop, and there’d be plenty there.
It was a ten-minute drive to Levi’s tea shop. Erwin remembered it from before, when Levi worked there as possibly the world’s grumpiest barista, but it was different now. They had painted the outside in a dark green, with gold writing in neat clean letters. Levi’s. As Levi unlocked, a blonde man from the bakery next door came into view with a stack of pastry boxes. Levi nodded to him, took the armload off him, before beckoning Erwin inside.
Inside the teashop was all warm wood panelling; five or six tables with the iron-legged chairs neatly stacked on top of them. Erwin moved them into position as Levi headed behind the counter, flicking on lights and equipment. The walls were either raw brick or a forest green, with minimal decoration otherwise. Behind the counter, shelving held jars upon jars of tea leaves, the chalk signing across the middle of each jar explaining the flavours. There was a small shelf of coffee, a begrudging concession, Erwin presumed.
“The bakery next door supplies pastries,” Levi said, pointing to the stack of cardboard boxes he’d placed neatly on the table. “We do alright. It’s what I always wanted. When I figured out what I wanted.”
“It’s nice,” Erwin said, though the words weren’t right. He’d never struggled with words before. That had always been Levi’s issue. It wasn’t so much he didn’t have the right words, simply that he felt he no longer had the right to speak as freely from fear that he might mess up. He’d lost so much of their life together. “You’ve worked hard.”
“I guess.”
Levi opened a fresh box of pastries and arranged them on the glass display stands. He took two custard filled tarts and placed them in a paper bag, folding the end closed, looking through the window. There were two kids ambling down the street, a dark-haired girl with a scowl large enough to rival Levi’s, and a blonde boy, perhaps a little older.
Erwin watched as Levi walked to the door, pulling it open and whistling to the two kids. “Oi brats, come here.”
“Mr Ackerman,” the boy said politely. Erwin caught the boy’s eyes and watched as his face widened. The girl continued to look incredibly grumpy, even if her eyes wandered over to Erwin as well.
“So he’s not dead then,” she said. “I heard that’s why you were closed last week.”
“Tch. Like I’d allow him to die. Here.” Erwin watched as Levi handed over the pastries to the girl. She grabbed both of them and didn’t say thanks. “Make sure you eat them. Come here after school. I won’t be around, but Furlan knows you get tea and fruit if you do your homework.”
“Yes sir,” the boy said. Erwin watched the girl eye Levi up, like she was trying to find a fault in his words; an ulterior motive. She shrugged, and they moved away. Levi stood and watched from the door until they disappeared around the block.
“Who are they?” Erwin asked, too curious to hide his vulnerability.
“Gabi and Falco. They’re foster kids from down the street here. They have a shit time, so I make sure they eat. That they do their homework.” Levi paused, touched his fingers to his chin for a moment. “Wish I could help more.”
“She reminds me of you.”
“What? Because she can’t smile?” Levi said, but it wasn’t poisonous. “He’s sweet, she’s a brat. I’d worry about Gabi more if she didn’t have him.”
“Sounds like they’re lucky to have you.” Levi didn’t bite back, but he appeared to shrink into himself slightly, and a flush settled over his cheeks.
Not long after, people showed up ready for take-away coffees and pastries. Erwin made his way to the small back room, sitting behind the desk as the humdrum of customers buying their teas filled the front, along with the heady scent of tea, of Levi’s noncommittal responses that somehow didn’t offend.
Erwin held his head in his hands, popped two painkillers to dull the throbbing and tried desperately to force away what he had imagined earlier that day whenever it tried to sneak back in. There’d been no blood, none sticking and staining his palm. It was all imagined. Fake.
Erwin went for a walk during a lull in service, squeezing Levi’s shoulder in explanation when he came into the back room. There was a small strawberry-blonde woman working now, cheery and sweet. She seemed to like Levi, seemed to know Erwin pretty well. Erwin couldn’t cope with having Levi explain something else to him, so left just as he opened his mouth.
Admittedly, Erwin hadn’t ventured into this town in a long time, but it wasn’t so different. There was still a florist across the street from the teashop, with buckets of roses blooming. There was a sign maker, and a faded bridal shop, a candy store, a footwear store that sold off-brand and discounted shoes. Some storefronts were different, but not much else had changed.
Erwin walked up and down, killed a half-hour at least and purchased a bouquet of winter roses from the florist, falling into an uneasy politeness when he grew a sense of familiarity with her too. He walked back into the store to the seats filled with customers enjoying their tea and pastries, but no one waiting to be served. Levi was behind the counter, straightening up the jars of tea. He frowned when Erwin approached, handing over the flowers.
“You bump your head again?” Levi asked, reluctantly taking the flowers from him. Erwin watched him trace the edge of a slightly wilting rose, bright red but darkening slightly, on the cusp of death. “These need water. I’ll put them in a jar.”
Levi disappeared out back, just as the young barista rounded from the back room, eyes wide and blue and fixed firmly on Erwin. She was smaller than even Levi, only Isabel’s height, when out of the boots he’d seen her in last night.
“I’m Petra,” she said to him, fully aware that he wouldn’t recall. He appreciated her frankness, how she wrapped it up with cheer. He held a hand and shook her, her small hand tucking neatly into his. “Oh, you always buy him flowers. You must remember. He pretends he doesn’t like them, but he presses and dries the ones he really loves.”
Erwin didn’t remember it becoming routine. He nodded his head at her all the same.
“Do I come here much?”
“Only to pick him up sometimes. I don’t think he likes people in his business.” She lifted her shoulders in a grimace. “I’m sorry about what happened. It must be awful.”
“Thankfully, I remember very little. I think it’s been worse for Levi.” At his name, Levi rounded the corner, the flowers sitting in a jug of water. He moved a leafy plant from the shelving behind and placed the bouquet in its wake.
“Petra says I often buy you flowers,” Erwin said on the drive back home later that day. They’d eaten a light lunch in the backroom. Petra had lingered, talking at them as if she knew them. Levi gave her little in the way of conversation, but Erwin smiled at her. She’d flushed and left them to it. Levi rolled his eyes but added nothing else.
“Not always,” Levi said, defensive, fingers curling over the steering wheel. “Sometimes you’d pick ‘em up if we were going out somewhere.” He used to buy flowers for Marie every Friday. Lilies even though the pollen brought him out with watery eyes and a wet, runny nose. Never would he buy those for Levi, for the sheer amount of pollen they lost. “You didn’t have to. Thank you.”
“You’re welcome.” It was awkward. Levi’s face was miserable. He’d been lost all day. Every conversation becoming more and more stilted until they finally turned into their road. “I think you had a flashback.”
“What?”
“This morning with the blood,” Levi said, pulling into the driveway. He eyed Erwin briefly, before he turned away.
“Do you think it was the car crash?”
“No.” Levi’s voice softened. He unclipped his seatbelt, but laid back in his chair, turning to look at Erwin’s face, or at least his mouth, rather than his eyes. “T isn’t birth control. I’ve always been good, but we slipped up last year.”
Erwin blinked, breathed and tried to process what Levi was saying. What he was implying. His chest tightened. “I’m confused.”
“I had a miscarriage because it’s not — you can’t on T. It’s not viable. We didn’t know until the morning when — uh. There was blood. A lot.”
“We lost a baby?”
“It wasn’t a baby. It was a bundle of cells. We’re not—” Levi sighed, forced himself to look at Erwin, who felt overwhelmed and anxious with the knowledge. “We would never have bio kids, Erwin. I did it once before I transitioned. I was just a dumb kid, but I couldn’t do it again.”
It had been a sticking point with Marie. He hadn’t felt ready for children, not as he was working so hard on his career, while she spent years staring at the clock, waiting for him to catch up.
Shocked, but mostly unsure how to proceed, Erwin asked, “Did we mourn?”
“It was traumatic — the shock of it, but only that.” Levi scrunched his nose up and looked away. “Sorry, I guess. That I didn’t tell you earlier or whatever.”
Erwin tried to think of something to say, but felt a strong sense of frustration that again, he could bring nothing memorable to the forefront of his mind. All his memories recalled were those he ought to leave behind.
“You sorted out your birth control?”
“Yeah, of course I did.” Levi’s eyes refused to meet his, and he looked wired, hands fisted in his lap. He stayed in the car for five minutes before following Erwin into the house.
Isabel was part of the local Roller-Derby team. They were going to watch her play and then tomorrow they were going to his father’s house. Somehow Erwin had to survive the spaces between these events, something that filled him a little with unease. The smaller parts he could cope with; the shared meals with his husband and step-daughter were only a little awkward. The rest of the world seemed beyond overwhelming.
Conversation was stilted on the drive to the roller-rink. Erwin’s mind still wracked with thoughts of miscarriages, of Levi’s casual way of telling him they had lost a child that neither of them wanted. Not a child. A bundle of cells, Levi had called it.
“I suppose it’s going to be full of people I won’t remember,” Erwin said, as they pulled up to join the line of cars waiting to park outside the rink. Not everyone would be as accommodating as Petra had been. “I feel like such a failure, for awaking in a life that I cannot remember.”
“It’s only been a few days, Erwin,” Levi said, gently. His hands twitched on the steering wheel, as if he wanted to reach out. He didn’t, and Erwin sighed heavily through his nose. “We won’t be interacting with anyone here, anyway. I got us banned from sitting in the friends and family section.”
“What did you do?”
“I questioned the actions of one of Isabel’s teammates. The fucking bitch knocked my kid over.” Erwin knew enough about Isabel; knew that she’d gotten banned from at least one pre-k for biting. She could more than hold her own. “The father of the other kid tried to lay into me, so I sprained his wrist. He tried to have me banned, but we worked it out so we just sit with the genpop.”
“That sounds familiar,” Erwin said with a laugh. “You always got yourself into trouble at the school gates.”
“Not without reason.” Levi pursed his lips, waving away the usher, who tried to direct him to a particular parking spot. Levi pulled up. It was a relatively small venue, but Erwin wished he could say he had an inkling of where he was. In reality, he had to follow Levi’s lead, apologising every time he accidentally bumped into him. He rocked his hands into his back pockets, to minimise his damage, head bowed down as he followed Levi to the second row.
Erwin only had a vague idea of the sport; certain he’d fallen asleep during a movie about it once, back when he was still dating Marie. It seemed mostly a case of a group of young people tearing around a roller-rink. Levi tried to explain the rules to him as they sat down, but it was mostly lost on him.
He was still in awe at the game, at the kids flying through the rink, jostling each other; the screeches of excitement, the flush sound of wheels as they careened around, the sound of the referee’s whistle, which called for Isabel more than any other.
Levi spent most of the game bent over the railing in front of them, eyes on Isabel. He didn’t screech or yell out like he could hear parents doing in the space closer to the rink, where they’d been banned from. Levi stood with his fingers curled over the metal railing, knuckles white, shoulders stretched and firm, hissing beneath his breath whenever Isabel was jolted. Erwin stared at his ass, how it curved slightly, hugged by the seat of his pants. He looked away when Levi turned to face him. He wasn’t sure if he’d been caught or not.
Isabel was good. Erwin could see that much. Fast and agile, so small she could weave in and out of everyone else with more ease than the others. He could hear her yells and cackles even as far away from the rink as they were.
Afterward, they waited in the auditorium for Isabel to amble over to them, a pair of battered skates with rainbow laces dangling from her fingers until Levi took them from her. They were heading to the diner built into the rink for burgers and fries. A Friday ritual whenever she has a game. Levi had told Erwin this quietly, no doubt to stop him from wandering off toward the exit.
Isabel looked younger than she did the night before, with all that glitter and spandex washed from her hair and body. Her hair was messy from where her helmet had been sitting, but her face was clear of makeup, her green eyes bright and sparking. She was wearing a faded Distiller’s t-shirt that Erwin remembered Levi wearing back when he was a teenager. Younger than Isabel was now. It made him feel old, realising that the tiny little red-haired girl was now this young woman. The little girl he’d babysat when Levi had his group therapy had smelled of weed last night, and was more grown now than he had ever known her.
“Did he start anymore fights?” Isabel asked, eyes hooked on Erwin as she smirked her crooked grin at him. It was rather infectious. “Or did he pretend that never happened?”
“He broke someone’s wrist, apparently,” Erwin said with a raised eyebrow.
“Yeah, and the other guy called you a cuck for not stopping him. Can you imagine that?”
“Izzy,” Levi said quietly, his face shadowed with pink. She dropped it, throwing her arm around Levi’s shoulders, leaning up to kiss his cheek as they made their way to the food joint.
The burgers were hot and salty, cheap but filling.There was loud rap music playing through the speakers as Erwin demolished a burger and fries, hungry in a way that he hadn’t been since he left the hospital. Isabel hummed along to the music, using two soggy fries to slap out a rhythm. Levi picked at his food. That, he thought, wasn’t all that different from what he remembered. Levi never ate enough, Erwin could put away mountains, while Isabel lived in a whole other world.
When his basket was finished, Levi pushed his own over to Erwin. He flushed a little, but Levi only rolled his eyes like this too was normal. At some point, Isabel had turned sideways in the booth, nails tapping on her phone until Levi yanked it from her hand.
“Eat your damn burger and stop harassing Church, kiddo.”
“You’re going up to your dad’s tomorrow?” Isabel said, ignoring Levi and turning her gaze onto Erwin even as she picked up her huge burger. She’d already removed the pickles, the slithers dangling on the side of her basket. “I loved that house. All those rooms to hide in whenever we stayed. I think the kitchen was bigger than that apartment we lived in at the time.”
“Probably,” Levi admitted with a shrug.
“It’s a nice house. I’m hoping I’ll remember more by going back.” He knew his father’s house. Knew the layout, knew the neighbours, knew where all the goddamn plates were stacked in the cupboard. It would be a relief to be there, rather than in his current home.
“Yeah, we were there a lot when your dad was sick.”
“Because he helped me first,” Levi said, almost defensive in tone. He looked embarrassed, like he wanted Isabel to shut up but couldn’t quite bring himself to tell her to. Which was odd. He’d never had much trouble with that before.
“He was a good man,” Erwin said eventually, rubbing at the dull grieving ache in his chest, fingers bumping against the ring sitting around his neck.
Chapter 3
Home
Mike and Levi didn’t like each other much. Erwin came to realise this after several attempts at getting them to bond together. Mike had a protective nature which cast a shadow around Erwin whenever he attempted to make friends. Perhaps because he had never been good at keeping them. People never stuck around much. Erwin could be intense and analytical, and his drive and focus on his career meant they fell by the wayside more often than not. Mike, for whatever reason, had always stuck around.
It was in the final quiet hours of a house party when Erwin really noticed. They were sitting in the living room of their small apartment — Erwin and Levi on the small couch together, Hange crossed leg on the floor with Mike sitting on the dining chair dragged over to complete the circle, sitting in it backwards with his arms folded over the wooden backrest, staring down at the rest of them. Hange was lighting a blunt, taking a wet suck on it as Mike talked.
“You’re a southern boy,” Mike said, eyes on Levi. Levi had spent most of the night brooding against the wall in the darkest corner until Erwin had peeled him from it and gathered him beneath his arm to talk shit. As old friends had said their goodbyes, and Levi made mumbling attempts to leave, Erwin had pushed him down onto the couch, a little drunk on whatever Hange had put in the punch.
“How did you work that out?” Levi said. Erwin watched him tilt his chin toward Mike. He had thought at one point two Levis stacked on top of each other might just about reach the same height as Mike. It had been funnier in his head than when he said it aloud to an unimpressed Levi.
“Got that bayou scent about you,” Mike drawled, thickening his own accent. Erwin, even as tipsy as he was, sensed the tension between the two of them. It only broke when Levi became distracted at Hange waving the blunt in his direction. He batted it away, like a fly swat.
“Huh, you don’t smoke?” They sounded surprised, but instead of offering again, handed the blunt to Mike instead.
“No,” Levi said slowly. He was sitting with one leg crossed over the other, his fingers folded over his knee. He looked out of place, and for a moment, Erwin felt bad for inviting him. “Plus, your breath stinks. I’m not sucking on a joint that’s been anywhere near your rancid mouth.”
“You’re really not endearing yourself to us,” Mike said, serious eyes on Levi, who Erwin noticed seemed to bristle every time Mike even glanced his way. “Where you from, really?”
“Never said I was born and raised here.” Levi pushed the hair from his face, wriggling his shoulders into the couch. He jolted Erwin beside him as he did so. “What’s it matter to you?”
“Don’t matter to me, kid. Just trying to figure you out.”
“Boys! You’re harshing my buzz,” Hange called out just as Mike leaned sideways to hand the blunt to Erwin, who hesitated before taking it. He didn’t indulge often, but the tension prickled with unease across his skin. He took a deep inhale, enjoyed the cloud of haze before holding it out to Levi. Figured maybe Levi would be less resistant if it came from himself rather than Hange. When he gave Erwin an irate expression, he backed away.
“You don’t smoke at all?”
“Got priorities,” Levi said. “Gotta be on my best behaviour under state care.”
“Oh yeah,” Hange said, “where’s the little Leviette, anyway?”
“Sleepover,” Levi shrugged. “She makes friends better than I ever did.”
“You should be nicer to him,” Erwin said to Mike some time later. They’d only taken a few hits each, so no one was all that stoned and they were making a half-hearted attempt to tidy up when Levi had chastised them for the state the other party-goers had left the apartment in.
“He’s not nice himself,” Mike said, and Erwin followed his gaze to where Hange and Levi were still sitting. Levi had a plastic cup in his hand and was quite obviously not listening as Hange speed-told him the fundamentals of their Masters.
“He is. It just shows in different ways. Why don’t you like him?”
“My dude,” Mike rubbed at the back of his head, something he always did when he was trying to order his thoughts. “I’m not judging him. Sounds like he’s probably had a shit time if he’s been in foster care most of his life, but you’ve done the math, right? Deducted his daughter’s age from his? That’s complicated. Erwin, you don’t need complicated. You push so many people away that might get in the way of your goals. I don’t understand what’s so special about him. Unless you’re… you know. Doing the goddamn do with a seventeen-year-old.”
“We’re just friends,” Erwin scoffed. They were and not just because Levi was underage. They did all the things that Erwin did with Mike, or Hange. They talked shit or Levi talked shit – he had a dearth of literal shit jokes that were never ending. It was easier; Levi demanded nothing of him, not really, he just let Erwin be. And he liked that. “And you’re being real classist.”
“I know,” Mike sighed, pouring the remnants of Hange’s punch down the sink. It gurgled and spluttered as he stretched his lips into a sheepish smile. “He just gives off a scent of trouble. I’m looking out for you. I don’t want you getting in trouble.”
“Just try for my sake — just back off a little, please?”
Mike paused for a time before nodding.
Five days later, Erwin was sitting in another diner. A new one because Levi had been fired from the last place. This one had better pie, Erwin had decided, although the coffee was nearly always burned. Levi realised this too. He didn’t fill Erwin's mug up nearly as much as he had before.
“Why did you get fired?”
“‘Cause the customers were pieces of shit and apparently I’m not allowed to let them know that,” Levi rolled his eyes. He was on a quick ten-minute break, huddled into the booth beside Isabel, who had fallen asleep with her face dropped forward onto the table. “Whatever.”
“Their loss,” Erwin teased, knowing that Levi had little use for sympathy.
“Whatever,” Levi shrugged again, looking down at the well-thumbed textbook in front of Erwin. He had an exam approaching and was sick at the thought of it.
“Do you think you and Mike will ever get along?”
“We get along fine,” Levi said, rolling his shoulder. He frowned and then scowled, then pressed his tongue behind his front teeth and tutted. Erwin just smiled at the flicker of expressions.
“He ain’t bad,” Levi said eventually. “First, I thought he was just a transphobe. Then I thought he figured I was a slut, because I’m the only kid he knows that got knocked up in middle school.”
“He thinks you’re going to cause trouble for me,” as Erwin spoke hesitantly, Levi’s eyes lit up
“Oh? Maybe I will.” He leaned forward on his elbows, skidding across the table. His hands fell over the textbooks. “Would you like that, Smith? Terrorised by your old school janitor?”
Erwin sat back, and laughed. “Maybe I would.”
Too much terrible coffee. That’s all it was. When Levi left after his break, Erwin usually left for the drive back home, only his stomach was churning and staring down at his notes wasn’t helping and he was sure he would pass, but the idea of not doing so, of letting his father down, and the family business down, was burning a flare behind his eyes. He didn’t panic often; was the calm storm for everyone else’s issues, but he could feel it. Rising higher and higher and higher an—
“Oi. Why’re you still here?”
Levi was frowning at Erwin, dressed in his jacket, Isabel’s strawberry-shaped backpack over one shoulder, breaking up the black he drowned in. He was holding onto her hand, and the two of them were staring down at him.
“Oh, I must have got carried away studying.” Erwin swallowed. If Levi was at the end of his shift, it meant he’d been sitting on it for at least two hours beyond normal. He hadn’t noticed Isabel waking, or Levi clocking out.
“You can’t live off pie,” Levi said, staring at the half-eaten plate still siting on the table. “Put your shit away and drive us back to my apartment.”
Erwin sat on Levi’s small second-hand couch as Levi boiled up pasta for them. Isabel was chatting away happily in her bedroom, her babyish voice carrying into the rest of the tiny apartment. Erwin felt hot. He pulled at his collar, had already yanked his coat and sweater off, leaving them neatly on the back of the chair.
“Jeez, you’re really giving off bad vibes,” Levi called, voice sounding closer as he stepped out of the kitchenette and stood in front of Erwin. Erwin looked up at him, saw something like worry creasing his forehead.
“I think I’m just a little overwhelmed with school.”
“It ain’t school, it’s everything else,” Levi said softly. He moved to take a seat on the couch beside Erwin and pressed his small hand to the centre of Erwin’s chest. It was a firm weight, cool, because Levi was always cold and his apartment was always chilly because he couldn’t afford to heat it. “Expectation, huh?”
“My father was a lawyer for the family firm. I have to prove I can do it as well.”
“Yeah, the Smith Family Law Firm, you’ve mentioned.” Levi smirked, but his hand didn’t stop the rough circles it was making. Even through Erwin’s shirt it felt good, slicing through the panic, grounding Erwin.
“My dad couldn’t cut it after my mom died. He had a breakdown and left the firm, started up an antique shop. I have to take it on, I have to do what he couldn’t, but what—” Erwin licked his lips. Levi was so easy to talk to, it was so easy to just let the fear creep out between his lips. He didn’t have to hide behind the facade he’d built. “What if I go the same way?”
“So what if you do? You could open a second antique shop. Who gives a fuck?”
“But I’d be letting so many people down.”
“Not your father. He’d want what’s best for you. He must because you talk about him so damn much.”
The idea of not being a lawyer was nice. Erwin wanted to teach, wanted to do the bare minimum of practicing until he’d built up enough experience to slip into academia. But already, he knew the right thing to do would be to stick to what was expected. He would graduate law school and he would practice somewhere else for a few years before coming back into the family fold and showing everyone that he was good, that he was the best, that his father hadn’t been able to hack it but he could. That his father had raised him well.
He must have slipped on the couch, because when he came out of his thoughts, he was bent awkwardly, with his head pressed to Levi’s chest, who was still sitting awkwardly on the couch beside him, hand now flat over Erwin’s heart.
“You done having your crisis or you need more mothering?” Levi quipped. Erwin could feel the vibration of his voice from his position. It roused him into action; he didn’t want to make Levi uncomfortable with the position they were in. He sat up, gentle as he wrapped his hand around Levi’s wrist - his entire wrist - and pushed it from his chest.
“Mothering or smothering?” Erwin teased, watching annoyance highlight Levi’s features, smoothing out the concern from before. He didn’t want Levi concerned for him, didn’t want to put him in that position again.
“Fuck off. Go wash your hands and get Isabel. The pasta's boiled over because of you.”
++++
“I want to drive.”
They were standing in the driveway, Levi’s beat-up car between them. Isabel stood at the door in pink leggings and a hoodie that was probably Levi’s. Her hair was damp from a shower and she had a steaming mug of tea in her hands. She’d spent the last five minutes promising to be ready to open up the teashop for Levi in forty-five minutes. Neither Levi or Erwin were all that convinced.
There was a part of Erwin that wanted to tell Levi to stay here, to continue living his life and Erwin would return. But he couldn’t do that. They were married. They were a partnership, and he needed him to help navigate this new existence they held.
At Erwin’s insistence that he wanted to drive, Isabel promptly slammed the door closed. Levi stared at Erwin with the keys dangling. “Levi, I know the way.”
“Yeah, but the last time you drove you—”
“You said the accident wasn’t my fault.” It can’t have been because the police had contacted once they had got back from the roller-rink. The other driver, charged with dangerous driving, had admitted to it and was taking a plea-bargain. Erwin, having remembered none of it, had simply thanked the police for informing him, and felt nauseas the rest of the night.
“It wasn’t. I just wasn’t sure if you were comfortable.” Levi closed his eyes, breathed in deep, as if he’d been taught such measures. Then he flicked his wrist, the keys flying in the air. Erwin had the reflexes to catch them and did so. He had to push the seat back once he sat in the driver’s seat, pulling the wheel down and adjusting the mirrors. Levi stared at him as he did so.
“You always hated driving this car,” Levi said eventually, perhaps because he knew Erwin wouldn’t remember and was feeling spiteful.
“I’ll have to look for my own, I suppose. Once all the insurance comes through,” Erwin said, ignoring the slight. He buckled up and waited for Levi to do the same.
It felt good driving. He’d always enjoyed it, had passed the first out of his friends, became designated driver in their early years, not because he was sober but because he could hold his beer better than all his friends. This felt like control. This was driving his best friend’s old battered car, the cheapest expensive thing he owned. The last time Erwin remembered it, there had been a red car-seat in the back, and a built in tape-deck. Now a pair of sparkly dice swung cheerfully beneath the rearview mirror. Isabel’s input, he figured.
Erwin drove without needing prompting. He knew the route to the freeway, had watched Levi take it the night before on their way to the rink, and he knew to stay on it for half an hour until the turning with the Marriott hotel. He felt good.
They spoke little. Whenever he looked over, Levi was staring through the window at the passing traffic, the sharp cut of his jawline bare. Erwin’s heart pulsed at the sight. He thought about how his ass had looked in those jeans as he bent over the rail at the rink the previous night. Remembered him younger and surly, in his punk shirts and his baggy hoodies, hiding himself away.
After another hour, they finally pulled up onto the street he’d grown up on. His father’s house was a squared townhouse; goldbricked with a front door painted red. It looked dark inside, with the curtains drawn over all the windows.
Seeing it flooded Erwin with memories; chasing out the door so he wasn’t late for his bus aged ten, climbing in through the second floor sash-window, where he left it open with that wedge of paper as a junior in high school. Coming back for holidays and summers during college; spending Christmas here with his father, Levi, and Isabel. That one beautiful holiday season.
“Ready to go in?” Levi asked, and Erwin nodded his head. In more recent years, he’d flown his father over to California. He’d rather serve his father; have him a guest in his own house, than a sorry son coming back to visit.
It was dark and dusty once they opened the doors. Erwin could see all the large pieces of furniture covered with wide cotton dust sheets; smaller stuff bundled into cardboard boxes stacked and labeled. The white bookshelves built into the gallery wall were empty. Erwin remembered how the books he remembered being there for years were sitting on the shelves in his house with Levi.
“When was I last here?” He asked Levi quietly.
“About six months ago,” he answered from a distance. He imagined Levi was slowly dying from the dust that had built up. When he looked over, he was standing in the doorway, hiding in the shadows, staring around the room with his arms folded over his chest. “He left the house to you, but you weren’t sure what to do with it. You focused more on handling the store.”
“I ought to check in on Artlet, I suppose,” Erwin said, remembering Levi mentioning Artlet’s young grandson, who now worked there.
“He’s okay. I spoke to him yesterday. You need to focus on your recovery,” Levi said.
“I suppose you’re right there,” Erwin muttered. Oƒn the walls, where old artwork once stood, there were now empty patches, lighter than the rest. “Did I sell the artwork?”
“You gave it to Moblit to handle. He knew what to do with that kinda shit.”
Moblit. Hange. Erwin hadn’t thought of them once since awakening in his current reality. Knowing he had at least some interaction with them was soothing. He thought of his phone, that he had told Levi to look after. Maybe it was time. Maybe it could…
He cleared his throat as he wandered through the house. He’d run scared of it or not scared, but perhaps ashamed. So many of his friends hadn’t the wealth he had, even more obvious when Levi and Isabel had come into his house as guests. Levi, who had no parents and a kid by the time he was fourteen, with his rough mouth and his tendency for violence whenever he felt threatened. Levi had felt so easily threatened back then, before Erwin had softened away his rough edges.
“Isabel said you were there with him near the end,” Erwin said when he finished his tour of the half-empty house. Levi was pulling a bucket from under the sink, unfolding cloths from a drawer, and running water to fill his bucket with.
“He wasn’t my dad. He wasn’t her grandparent, but that didn’t matter to him. He took us in when he didn’t have to, when we didn’t have any other adult that gave a fuck. I couldn’t give much, but I could look after this place when it got too much. Make sure he took his meds, you know? Make sure he felt cared for.”
“I suppose I didn’t do that,” Erwin said. He’d been there with his father; they spoke on the phone once a week. He flew back every so often and they went for dinner in the city.
“I don’t know,” Levi said, turning his back on Erwin to fill the bucket with soap, before lifting it into the sink. Erwin stared at his back, the rigidness and coiled muscle. “How the fuck do I know what a good son is? You did what you could.”
“‘What I could’ doesn’t mean enough.”
“Stop the self pity, Erwin. Grow some fucking balls and deal with the choices you made.” It wasn’t shouted at him, but said rather flatly. Levi was holding the now full bucket in his hands, muscles pulled taut. He blew at his bangs until they fluttered up and then into his eyes again. Erwin nodded at the words, at whatever the implication was. “Take you shoes off. I want to wash the floor.”
Erwin did as he was told and moved to the living room again, pulling back the dust sheet covering the couch. He sat on it, huffing out a laugh when he sunk to the middle. He’d forgotten it did that. He remembered deliberately sitting in the centre, remembered Isabel jumping up beside him and giggling when she rolled toward him with the uneven weight.
He remembered his father sitting in the armchair beneath the window, his favoured spot to read. A shot of whiskey in his hot cocoa every night between Christmas and New Year; how he would insist on calling Levi’s Christmas presents birthday gifts after Levi had tried to squirm out of his very first holiday here.
Erwin thought back further, being a small child with his father in this house too big for the two of them. His mother had long since passed, and prior to Levi’s arrival, their Christmases had been small, quiet affairs. They ate food at the table but retired to the living room. His father showing off oddities and antiquaries he hadn’t yet added to the store. Erwin would read the piles of books stacked up on the bookshelf, reading the words even if the content flew over his head.
“Hey.” Erwin stirred to Levi sitting in front of him, crouching down, head tilted just slightly, hand resting lightly on Erwin’s knee. “You were a good son, Erwin. You were his world. Quit your blubbing. Don’t make me feel guilty.”
Erwin pressed a hand to his cheek — it was wet. He sniffed, and an embarrassing amount of snot rolled back up his nose. Levi made a disgusted face and Erwin laughed. His knee was warm where Levi’s hand was resting on it.
“I just can’t work out the gaps. All of those last moments with him gone.”
“Yeah,” Levi said, patting Erwin’s knee before he stood up. “Look, I’m gonna clean the kitchen down. I didn’t get to do it the last time we came back. You should head to the cemetery. That’s what you wanted, right?”
“Yes, I think I need to.” Erwin sniffed. The skin beneath his eyes felt tight where the tears had dried. His head throbbed with its usual painkiller-dulled headache. He wanted Levi to come with him, but no, he needed the space. Ought to say goodbye to his dad again.
His parents had matching gravestones despite the two decades that split their deaths. Erwin must have arranged that. Simple, clean font. Eric Smith. Beloved father. The plot was well kept. No fresh flowers, but neatly trimmed and a plant that looked to weather most seasons. He bent down, touched the marble gravestone, wished he was the sort to feel the presence of the dead, but his father was dead and there was no coming back from that.
He closed his eyes and his vision blurred as he recalled suddenly; a too tight black suit and shoes that pinched, the wet soaking through. The sharp bite of Marie’s nails as she held tight to his hand. Two small figures beside him, one black-haired, the other red, tucked together under an umbrella.
Erwin blinked his way out of the flashback and back to the mild weather now. To crouching at his father’s grave, with his mother laid to rest beside him.
He didn’t remember the drive back to his father’s, with his mind fractured between the recalled flashback and the rest of the nothingness. The handsome gravestones, his mother’s clearly older but just as well cared for. It felt a mockery to be standing there alone, too afraid of remembering more. He flew through the front door and into the kitchen, startling Levi into looking up from where he was kneeling in the corner, washing down the cabinet doors.
“It rained the day of the burial. My feet hurt because I always wear the same too-small dress shoes to funerals,” Erwin said, almost slipping where it was wet. He pulled his sneakers off now and moved them to the corner, so as not to tread any dirt onto the floor.
Levi tutted at him from his spot in the kitchen, but his eyes were up and curious. “You had a flashback?”
“Just briefly. You and Isabel under an umbrella beside Marie and I. It isn’t much,” Erwin said, when he realised it. Barely a second remembered out of the years lost.
“More will come back with time,” Levi said. Erwin breathed deep, becoming aware that it smelled delicious in the kitchen. Hot and sour soup with dumplings, a classic Ackerman dish. He must have prepared between cleaning sessions. Erwin had lost more time than he realised at the cemetery. “It fucking poured it down that day.”
“And I didn’t have an umbrella.”
“Well, you weren’t going to fit under mine,” Levi said. “And you had your wife with you.”
An awkward pause ensued. Erwin wasn’t sure, wasn’t sure how it ended, or how to cure the slight sorrow in his chest that the thought of his marriage to Marie being over with, even if it meant having Levi. His feelings for Levi had been complicated over the years. He’d pushed it aside at all costs, even when he knew Levi was waiting, forever wanting.
“I was thinking I’d quite like to have my phone back. I think I’m ready,” Erwin said, once he’d washed up and sat opposite Levi for dinner. Levi had even changed the bedding in Erwin’s old room, while Erwin had pulled himself together and the stew cooked on the hob. He felt better at seeing his father’s resting point; for being back in his childhood home. Driving himself had helped too.
Now they sat opposite each other as the sun dimmed low, a candle lit on the table between them as Levi portioned out the two bowls.
“I’m glad. Felt weird carrying it around with me,” Levi said. The food was just as good as Erwin remembered. Levi was a good cook; good with stews and soups, and comforting food that warmed you from the inside out. “Like I got you cucked or some shit.”
“Perhaps a little.” Erwin swallowed a mouthful down, thinking about his friends. Mike and Nana. Their wedding. Levi’s confession — shamefully not his first that Erwin had rejected, though it had been quieter the first time, easier to move past. “You mentioned Moblit earlier. Are he and Hange still together?”
Levi nodded his head. “Yeah, they’re still whatever. And there’s Pieck now too.”
“Pieck?”
“Yeah, they have a third. Or Hange has a second. They all live together like some hippie commune. Moblit’s making bank with his art gallery, Hange still makes shit explode. They want to see you, but probably to poke at your head a bit, so I told them to chill.”
“I would like to see them.” They had been an odd group in college; Mike, Hange and Erwin. Sticking together even after they graduated, after Mike got the job in the gym and Hange and Erwin moved onto their postgraduate studies.
“Maybe Mike first?” Levi suggested, eyes diverted down. “You guys are still close.”
“Do they have kids?” Erwin asked. They had been talking about trying around the same time Marie and Erwin had discussed it, or she was quietly pleading and he was waiting and waiting to be ready.
“No, but they do a lot of work with inner-city kids and free gym programmes. That keeps them busy.”
“Did you guys ever learn to get on?”
“For your sake, sure,” Levi shrugged, but then was pointing his fork at Erwin’s bowl of steaming stew. “Eat your dumplings before they get cold.”
The rest of the evening fell away in a peaceful quiet. Levi was quite meditative when cleaning, and so there was no spiky bluntness whenever Erwin asked about their life. They washed the dishes together and Erwin took a secret pride because he knew exactly where to place them when dry. He knew more about this house than even Levi.
Afterward, he roamed the house again, absorbing himself in memory as he opened the door to his father’s office. It could be thirty years back and he was a child creeping around the door, his father catching him out of bed and chastising him gently. Pulling him into his lap for one final warm hug before bed.
Or the second-floor landing where he’d had his first kiss with a girl he had crushed on. His tongue had caught on her braces and split his bottom lip. The crush had faded with the mortification, but he thought of her now, wondered what she had done with her life.
“Is that what I think it is?” Erwin said sometime later, when he found Levi sitting outside, on the deck that lead out through the kitchen door. He had a blunt rolled between his fingers, glowing red as he sucked it into his mouth.
“If Isabel wants me to do her laundry, she should go through her pockets first,” he said. “I’ve been confiscating this shit for at least two years now. She thinks I don’t know.”
Erwin took a seat beside Levi and grabbed the joint between his fingers. The scent of it took him back to his undergrad days, as far away as they were now. The biggest smoker of the bunch had been Moblit, funnily enough. Erwin had preferred cigarettes.
“This is clean stuff,” Erwin said, holding it in his lungs long enough to get a decent hit from the blunt. He handed it back to Levi, watching him inhale as he let a slow cloud out from between his lips. “Do we do this often?”
“Nah, not really, but grief makes you look like you need a giant shit. Not a good look. Thought this might help.”
“Remember when you refused to smoke with us, that time you stayed over after the party? You blamed it on Hange’s breath.”
“When Mike was trying to smell out a rat?” Levi laughed. “You guys didn’t to get that I had bigger issues if they caught me doing illegal shit.”
“Yeah, we were idiots like that.”
Erwin had left the door ajar and while the warmth of the kitchen warmed their backs, Levi was still shaking from the chill of the night air. Erwin wrapped an arm around him, pulling Levi in toward him to share his heat. For a moment, Levi froze before he sunk into him, face tucked to his chest.
They sat like that for a good few minutes until they finished the blunt. Touching Levi here in his father’s house, where they had shared memories together, it felt good. It felt right. Better than it did in the house they called home. He squeezed Levi’s shoulder, breathed in the scent of his hair when he dipped his face down.
“I can count on one hand the times you’ve touched me since you woke up from your coma,” Levi said, pulling away slightly. He drew his knees to his chest and rested his chin on top of them. “Yesterday you held me in the morning and it felt like before.”
Erwin reached out, drew his fingers down the sides of Levi’s face, watched him shiver and shake as he tilted his face towards him, two fingers beneath his chin.
“I think I’m afraid of doing everything wrong,” Erwin said. “Upsetting you for failing to meet the standards I’ve previously set. It’s nothing to do with how I feel about you.”
“I’m too stoned to work out what you mean by that,” Levi said. “Just tell me if you want me or not.”
“I want you,” Erwin said, leaning in. Levi moved in for the kiss right away, pressing his lips gently to Erwin. It was true, he had avoided touching him, but Levi hadn’t acted much like he wanted it either, too cautious. But the kiss was a trigger of some sort, a spark in his head where suddenly everything made sense, or the slow relaxation of the weed gave him courage to touch, to hold, to have Levi in the ways he had forced himself not to for so long.
It was a slow fumble as Erwin stood up, almost falling over Levi before hoisting him to his feet as well. Levi was muttering something against his lips, his hands fisting upwards, curling tight to Erwin’s shirt before he dragged Erwin inside. His brain was short-circuiting, high enough that every touch was electric, even if it was just Levi’s hand in the small of his back as they moved upstairs.
They made it to Erwin’s bedroom with only minimal stumbling. Erwin found the more he pressed against Levi’s mouth, the harder it was to detach. They had kissed before, but the last he remembered was the one in the storage closet at Mike’s wedding, and this wasn’t that.
“You lost your virginity in this bed,” Levi said against his mouth, pulling away to sit on the edge of the bed. His cheeks were pink, mouth swollen as he tilted upwards, staring at where Erwin towered over him. Getting high made him looser in the mouth, less wound-up. “And now you’re fucking me in it, huh.”
“Have I fucked you in it before?” Erwin asked, but Levi shook his head, his hair falling over his eyes.
“When we come back, we’re not normally in the mood. Dead dad and all.”
Erwin bent down so that he was kneeling in front of Levi, with the added height of the bed, they were now almost equal. His hands slipped to Levi’s thighs, feeling them through his dark jeans. His muscles pulsed and twitched even through the thick material.
“Will you let me see you?”
“Whatever,” Levi shrugged, but his hands were skimming the hem of his shirt, dragging it up. He pulled it off with minimal fuss, fumbling it over his head, senses dulled by his intoxication, but Erwin bent lower, resting his chin on Levi’s knee as he looked up at him.
Levi was fit, faint abs defined beneath his stomach, the dark curl of hair starting from just below his navel, hidden beneath the waist of his pants. Erwin’s eyes skimmed upwards, over his chest, the scars barely visible. His pink nipples pebbled; exposed as they now were. Erwin noticed a metal bar in each one, and the saliva in his mouth thickened.
“Oh, I like those,” Erwin said, and he was joining Levi on the bed, pushing him back to straddle him, sloppy in his stone-hindered movements. He felt Levi laugh as he pressed his lips in the centre of his chest, skirting his hands up Levi’s ribs. He was slight enough that he could fit his hands around him.
“Yeah, you do.” Levi stopped to gasp as Erwin sucked the bar into his mouth, tugging on it gently, his nipple peaking at the sensation. He just wanted to devour him, wanted to suck his skin pink all over, lather him with attention in all the ways he’d resisted for so long. He pulled back to catch his breath, to stare down at the other man.
“You’re beautiful,” he said, hands grasping first to the hot skin at the back of Levi’s neck. He stroked him there, felt the top bump of his spine and saw Levi’s lashes flutter close at the words.
“You haven’t touched me…” Levi said, “I wasn’t sure.”
“I wanted to. It’s just been hard,” Erwin swallowed, tongue looser with the weed, with the way Levi was still squirming beneath him. “I don’t remember… What you like.”
“Then relearn.” Levi’s eyes flickered upwards, gaining confidence again as he lifted his hands and cupped Erwin’s face in them, pressed their lips together. They kissed, just small pecks and then a little more, Levi slipping in tongue as his hands moved from Erwin’s face, down the column of his throat, his shoulders and chest before they moved up under the fabric, forcing them to part so Erwin could remove his shirt. Levi was staring at him, small mouth damp and open, delicate hands pawing at Erwin’s sides, his chest, squeezing up gently over his throat before finding their grip in his hair.
Erwin continued, half distracted by Levi’s burning touch. “That’s to say I wish to respect your body.”
Levi seemed to realise, and he nodded his head. “I don’t have much dysphoria down there. You can touch me wherever, I like it however you give it. As long as it’s you, I don’t mind.”
Erwin swallowed dry at the implication. That Levi allowed him access to his body, all parts of it.
Erwin ducked down the length of Levi’s body spread out beneath him on the bed, mouthing at Levi’s abs, at the very faint slither of stretch marks, the sparse trail of hair beneath his navel. Levi allowed himself to be touched, kissed, and worshiped in this way. His tongue lathered and his lips sucked at his belly button to the gasping shock of Levi, who when Erwin looked up, had one hand tugging at his own hair, his other hand cupping the back of Erwin’s head. Erwin leaned up again, sucked a nipple into his mouth, tugging gently on the piercing.
Erwin teased the barbell with the top of his tongue, rolled the piercing around and felt Levi’s nails dig into his shoulder-blades. He sucked and bit down, just sharp enough that Levi hissed.
“How long have you had these?” Erwin asked as he pulled away just to suck at the right nipple this time, rolling the bar into his mouth and hearing the effect it had on Levi’s breathing.
“Before you,” Levi said, chest heaving, the dual silver metal sparkling as the rest of him remained wet and swollen; pink. Erwin mouthed downwards again, the sharp valley between his abs, tongue slipping into his bellybutton, still damp from before. He tasted so clean; of faded soap and the detergent he used for their clothes. He looked up between his eyelashes, saw Levi’s red eyes, his slow blinking expression, small mouth open on a part.
“You should get this pierced,” Erwin said, pinching the skin above his navel. Levi grimaced, flushed pink. His hips lifted, but Erwin's chin rested flat against them. He could smell his arousal through the jeans.
“You’ve said that before.” Levi’s teeth, sharp and white, peeled through his stretched lips. Erwin was hard in his own pants, but this was about Levi. He wanted to give the man his pleasure after ignoring him. Wanted Levi to know he was loved, he deserved that.
“Then I must have meant it.”
His entire hand fit the front of Levi’s abdomen. It made him feel like a giant, clumsy, addled as he was by the weed. He could feel Levi’s muscles quivering beneath his touch as his hand slipped down lower, thumbing open the button of his jeans, his pinky shifting just enough to give the zipper enough of a push to slide down.
“Would you let me worship you?”
“Fuck off.” Levi said, but his hips lifted, his hands sliding to the waist, pushing them down, his dark underwear with it. Erwin helped slide the slim pants down his narrow legs and over his feet. He was flushed as he looked at Erwin, almost shy until he opened his legs, but Erwin - stoned and without the usual ease - grappled his hands around Levi’s knees - his thumbs sliding to the hot crease behind before he carefully pushed them apart.
Levi was neatly groomed between his legs. Dark hair trimmed into a buzz, like he took care to keep himself tidy. He clicked his tongue when Erwin parted his legs, but didn’t resist otherwise. He was pink beyond the dark, and a little wet. Erwin could see the glistening trails.
Erwin licked his thumb into his mouth, got it nice and wet before he rolled it against Levi’s growth, sitting proud against the dark hair. Levi gasped, slapped a hand to his face, rolled his hips upwards as he fell backwards. Erwin laughed, slow to react, mouthing at the inside of Levi’s thigh, shouldering beneath the bend of his knee so his leg curved over Erwin’s shoulder.
He’d thought about it before, back when they had danced around each other. Erwin would think about Levi climbing on top of him, as small as he was, taking charge, talking shit. Erwin thought maybe he’d be able to fuck the complaints out of him. He’d never thought beyond the logistics. He just thought about how Levi would moan and gasp and ask for more. Erwin would say yes yes yes until he came sticky and wet in his hand, before shame took over.
Erwin was rolling his thumb against Levi, in neat little circles, watching him writhe against the bed, watching his own name fall from his small mouth as he hardened against him. Levi’s legs shifted from his shoulders, knees up to his chest, and Erwin got a brief peek of Levi’s other hole before his legs, strong as hell, tightened around his waist, pulling him in. Erwin fell forward, wriggling up Levi’s body with his hands on either side of Levi’s head, their noses inches apart. He could feel Levi’s damp breath against his mouth, his eyelashes against his own.
“Fuck me,” Levi said, and Erwin’s brain short-circuited for half a second, swallowing back saliva as his mouth filled at the words. All his nerve endings felt on fire as the bubbling high covered them both. Erwin’s other hand, the one that wasn’t teasing Levi by moving lower to bury into his heat, cupped the back of his head.
“I’d like a taste before I fuck you,” Erwin said, pressing a kiss to Levi’s lower lip, to the tip of his nose, to all the high points of his face.
“Put your mouth on me then,” Levi gasped when Erwin pulled back. He got off the bed, kneeling instead beside it, grabbing onto Levi’s knees and dragging him until he was level with the edge of the bed. Erwin leaned over, let his mouth fill with saliva and then watched as he let it pour from his mouth to Levi’s heat, slicking it wet.
He sucked at Levi’s dick, used a gentle tongue on him and heard the muffled moan from Levi, who lifted his legs to wrap around Erwin’s neck. Erwin sucked gently, getting used to it, lapping at the sides of his folds whenever he sensed the pressure was too much.
Levi was small, and Erwin was big. Even with previous partners, there had always been plenty of coaxing, lube and fingering. They’d never wanted him in their ass, but Levi had said . Erwin held onto one of Levi’s asscheeks, spreading them open.
He looked upwards, through his own lashes, to see Levi hiked up on his elbows to support the weight not hanging off the bed, staring down at Erwin between his thighs, mouth smeared with saliva and slick.
He rolled his fingers over Levi’s cock, spitting on them, getting them nice and wet until they slid easily against Levi’s skin, until they skimmed down past his front hole to lower. He pressed inside the spongy heat of Levi’s ass, unable to withhold his own moans as Levi helped by bearing down slightly. His two fingers disappeared inside.
He rocked them back and forward, kissing lazily at Levi’s growth to give his tongue a rest. Levi was squirming on the bed, hips shifting up as he bumped up against Erwin’s mouth.
“You like me in your ass?” He asked, pulling away and looking up at Levi. He could feel Levi’s dampness sticking to his chin, along with his own saliva. His hair flashed gold in his eyes from where Levi had tugged on it, but Levi didn’t answer, just closed his eyes and sighed, his body rising and falling.
Levi was so small that Erwin could slip his thumb into his other hole, slick and pink as it was. Not as wet as his arousal suggested, but turned on as hell. Erwin had no memory of ever hearing him, of seeing him like that, but he was too overcome to even think about the sorrow in that.
He was pulsing in his own pants, leaking heavily enough that he sensed a wet spot forming, but he ignored it for now. Only wanted to think about how he had Levi beneath him, squirming and saying his name between curses. Erwin fucked Levi with his hand, fingers deep in his ass, thumb circling and teasing his opening. With added spit, he squelched with every rock of Erwin’s hand.
“If you’re going to come, you should,” Erwin said as he drew for breath. He sucked again at Levi, heard his pitched cries, neck cramping and breath cutting short as Levi clamped his thighs around Erwin’s neck and pulled him in.
He pressed his tongue inside, swapping it with his thumb. Levi was pulsating and tight. He choked up at the thought of it being his dick. He could feel where his fingers were crooked deep in his ass. Levi came like that, Erwin barely breathing, fingers and tongue deep in his body.
“Oh my god,” Levi gasped, when he finally loosened his thighs from Erwin. His hands were in his hair, damp with sweat. He was shaking all over, legs still hitched up. He was swollen between his thighs. Erwin pulled his hand away and watched Levi’s body gape at the sudden loss.
Erwin’s hands moved to his belt. He was throbbing and aching with how he was constricted, how he had ignored his own body to focus on Levi. God, he hadn’t had sex while he was high in at least twenty years - that he remembered - it made it slower, made his brain feel warm, made it easier when he had barely touched Levi at all since leaving the hospital. Too afraid of what his life now was, trying to understand what he had lost and gained.
He hissed when he pulled open his pants and slapped a hand around his cock. His fingers were still slick from where he’d been fucking Levi and he wrapped them around his length, his cock red and dribbling. He was big. He looked down at his cock and at Levi’s slim figure on the bed. Levi realised and nodded his head, opening his legs in agreement, but Erwin shook his head.
“I won’t last,” he admitted, and hid the part that maybe wasn’t ready for that either. “Can I come on you?”
Levi nodded, pulling himself open with his fingers as Erwin straddled his thighs. At least he hadn’t forgotten his favoured technique, tight and quick, a thumb over the head, the slight flick of his wrist. Levi moved one hand to Erwin’s face, pulling at him with determinedly nifty fingers, whispering desperate words against him as Erwin’s hand slapped against his skin.
“Come on me, Erwin. Make me yours, fuckin’ do it,” Levi was saying, and Erwin conceded with a choked groan, his eyes rolling back as he came. He directed his stream over Levi’s body, so that he painted his thighs, the neat dark hair, the pink still-pulsing skin below.
“Oh my god,” Erwin said when he finished. He’d dropped on top of Levi, breathing in the scent of him; sweat and sex and the faded shampoo from his morning shower, and soap beneath it all. Levi groaned and squirmed from beneath him, ruffling Erwin’s hair as he sat upright. “Is it always that good?”
“You consider that good?” Levi said, though his eyes were still hazy when their gaze locked. “You’ve never asked to come on me before. That must be an unlocked kink. Not sure I like it.”
“Do I not normally ask?” Erwin teased, laughing when he heard Levi grunt something vile at him. He watched Levi leave the room, tiptoeing down the corridor to the bathroom.
Erwin was almost asleep when Levi came back five minutes later, freshly cleaned up. He crawled into the bed beside him, still naked, pressing himself up against Erwin’s chest. Erwin wrapped his arms around him. He fit in his own little way, small and snug, smelling clean as anything. The scent of sex washed from his skin.
“You’re the only sex I’ve had sober where I’ve not freaked the fuck out,” Levi said quietly, as Erwin tucked his damp hair behind his ears. He could feel Levi’s pulse with his fingers so close to his throat, but his voice was gentle and sluggish; thick with the reaction to the weed and his orgasm.
“We’re not sober right now,” Erwin reminded him, though the haze was fading.
“Yeah, but otherwise. Normally. When I was with Zeke, we used to joke about keeping a bottle of Valium with the sex toys,” Levi laughed and Erwin did with him, though he supposed it wasn’t all that funny. The more he thought of it, the closer he held Levi, memories flooding back.
“Remember that time you called me?”
“Yeah. Hence the Valium.” Levi’s hands wrapped around Erwin, the tips of his fingers pressing to his spine. “Gonna fall asleep. G’night.”
Erwin awoke in the early hours to Levi still curled up against his chest. He’d burrowed down in the night, holding onto him tightly, afraid perhaps of losing the intimacy again. It had come on so quickly. He’d burned himself out in grief, calmed himself down with weed, and fucked the most complicated person he knew all within a few hours.
Erwin’s bladder forced him up eventually, extracting himself delicately enough that Levi didn’t awake. He just pressed his face into Erwin’s pillow, seeking his warmth, moaning under his breath. Erwin went to the bathroom, washed his hands afterward and stared at himself in the mirror.
The gash on his forehead was healing itself. It itched a little, and was bruised around the outside. When he smiled, creases sunk in a little further, but otherwise, he was the same. He looked better, fitter. Despite Levi’s grumbling, that was damn good sex. He hadn’t come like that in such a long time. Not that he recalled.
Levi was still asleep when Erwin made his way back into the bedroom, breathing softly as he buried himself among the comforter and blankets. Erwin saw his phone sitting on the side, where Levi had left it charging. He pulled on his sweater and pyjama pants he hadn’t bothered changing into before and grabbed the phone, tiptoeing down the stairs.
It was cold, and they hadn’t bothered putting the heat on in the house, so Erwin set up the log-burner until it flickered out warmth, and sat in his father’s old armchair, feet warmed by the fresh flames.
He switched his phone on, stroking the back of it as it came to life. As the Apple logo faded, the lock screen came up, and he was faced with a version of himself he hadn’t seen before, his blond hair softened by the wind blowing it about his forehead, the rocky terrain setting a decent hiking trail behind them. Levi had tucked himself under his shoulder, eyes on the camera, face placid, although Erwin could see the smile in how the corners of his eyes had picked up; in the slight upturn of his mouth.
He didn’t know where they were, couldn’t work it out. Nowhere close to home, so a vacation maybe. Honeymoon? Erwin wondered where they married, if it was a small affair. Levi wouldn’t want anything large. Just his kid. Just Erwin.
He clicked the side of his phone, grateful that the technology had advanced little in the past four years. Previously, his phone had opened via thumb print, but now it seemed to recognise his face. He swiped the lock screen open. His home screen was another landscape, a candid shot of the city that he must have taken one time or another.
It took time for him to feel ready to open any apps, to see what his daily life comprised of, so he started with his messages, ignoring the long row of bold unread messages until he found Levi’s name. He pressed it until the page of messages opened.

He read through the messages above and soon realised that in marriage, Levi appeared about as communicative as he had been in Erwin’s memories. Short answers, or simple thumbs up. He was a poor speller, always had been; and hid it behind the use of photos rather than words. Demanding Erwin pick up milk and the correct detergent this time, with a photo of his favoured brands. Nothing all that sentimental. He was grateful for that.
His heart had opened to the idea of Levi, being in his father’s house, with their shared experiences together — the faint taste of Levi still alive in the back of his throat, but being in a relationship was different and he had refused himself it for years. it was hard, unable to work out what had changed him.
He opened his messages with Isabel and winced at the images of her work in college; gashes over cheeks, a split open and oozing brain. Her own stomach bared with gashed and pierced skin. Red globs of blood and gore artfully designed. He’d left a heart beneath each photo.
The last words written were a clearly panicked don’t tell dad about the weed pleeeease. He laughed, remembering how imbedded it had been on her clothes the first time they had re-met. That he’d just fucked her father high on her leftover stash.
Beyond Isabel, there were so many missed calls, texts from names he remembered and some he didn’t; all telling him to get well soon. He hovered over Mike’s name, pressed down on it to open up the messages. Nothing out of the ordinary. Their last conversation was about meeting up for their next gym session.
You still on? he messaged back. Levi was probably right, he was a good first point of call and he wanted to stay in shape. Erwin’s phone buzzed in his hand, and he expected it to be Mike confirming despite the late night, but Levi’s name popped up at the top of the screen. Erwin selected it, watching the message fill the screen.
its cold. come back to bed
Erwin smiled, locking the phone and placing it in his pocket. Something warm and comforting oozed in his chest. Levi was his husband, an idea he had pushed away and away, for years, so desperate to keep his feelings for him locked away, into the box of things he refused to touch for fear of ruining.
He put out the fire and padded upstairs to where Levi was waiting for him.
++++
Levi agreed to go back with Erwin that Christmas, to his father’s row house north of the city limits. He wasn’t sure how he managed it; corralling Isabel into thinking it was a good idea had helped, especially when he discovered that Levi’s birthday fell on Christmas Day. He couldn't bare the idea of Levi spending it alone. Mostly, he had let slip to his father that he had a friend who didn’t have anywhere to go. His dad had insisted he bring him home. He just hoped that Levi didn’t think they considered him a charity case.
“I hate Christmas,” Levi had said, as Erwin drove them out of the city and up to his father’s. Isabel had gone straight from chatting away happily in the back, to fast asleep with her head dropped. Erwin watched Levi checking her every so often, but didn’t comment. “At least this year I finally get to say fuck you to the system. No more sucking up to social workers.”
“I find it hard to believe you’ve ever sucked up to anyone.”
“Ain’t that the goddamn truth,” Levi said quietly. When Erwin turned, he had a smile on his face.
Levi wasn’t coy, and he wasn’t meek, yet he shrank into himself when they showed up on his father’s doorstep, a weighty red-feathered wreath hanging from the heavy door. His father had opened the door with a wide smile on his face for the three of them, and a filthy apron wrapped around his torso.
His dad was an excellent cook: had somehow slipped out of the corporate world and into something softer during Erwin’s childhood. Home-cooked meals and fresh sheets, and always willing to drive Erwin to his after-school clubs and activities. All the stuff that made his childhood seem warm and loving, despite the absent, darker parts. The loneliness he felt with a mother he loved but lost so young. He’d no cousins to play with, and just the one uncle who had remained a bachelor. He presumed his parents would have had more children if his mother hadn’t been taken so young.
Still, when Erwin’s father held his hand out to Levi in the large foyer, Levi had been quick to hold his own out, frowning as they shook but quickly retreated it behind his back the moment he could. Isabel had mostly been happy for a new audience in Erwin’s father and was happy decorating sugar cookies with him as Erwin showed Levi around the house.
Levi’s bedroom was next door to Erwin's, a sizeable guest bedroom with crisp white sheets stretched over the fluffy comforter. Like a hotel, Levi had said, almost in awe. Erwin held back the laughter, knowing Levi was prone to taking it the wrong way.
“You dad knows his way around a feather duster, huh?” Levi said, skirting two fingers along the walnut dresser against the furthest wall. He almost smiled when the pads of his fingers came away clean.
“I think he probably made the effort for your arrival,” Erwin admitted. “Shall I show you where Isabel will be?”
“She’ll be here with me,” Levi said, not short but firm enough that Erwin swallowed back the rest of his words. “I uh. Just prefer to keep her close.”
“That makes sense.” Erwin nodded his head, chin to chest. He didn’t linger, understood without understanding, and changed the subject. “Are you looking forward to turning eighteen?”
“I guess,” Levi shrugged, arms folded over his chest as he stared over Erwin’s shoulder. “Won’t be a kid anymore. Never felt like one anyway.”
“You have the misfortune of looking far younger, but you won’t have to suffer with fake IDs anymore.”
“Misfortune? Shut up, blondie, you don’t have a clue,” Levi said, but this time he was smirking a little.
It was a good holiday season, the best Erwin could remember. Levi came out of his shell after remaining silent for the two days leading up to Christmas. He refused to go to church with Erwin and his father, but they all wrapped up warm for a walk to the street five minutes from Erwin’s house, where everyone brought into the festive spirit by lighting their front lawns and houses up with garlands of lights, ornaments of gold bulbs and luminescent snowmen standing in for angels in select Nativity scenes.
“Vile,” Levi said beneath his breath, but when Erwin looked down at him, his eyes were sparkling and he had a glow about him. On Erwin’s shoulders, Isabel counted every light-up reindeer she saw, verbally adopting them herself.
Levi turned eighteen on Christmas Day. They opened gifts in the morning; sweaters from his father for the three of them. Levi had brought fancy coffee that came in a tin for Erwin, to make up for the shit he served in the diner, and a bottle of whiskey for Erwin’s father. He refused to answer questions about how he purchased alcohol several years below the drinking limit when Erwin’s father questioned him.
Erwin had gifted colouring books and pencils to Isabel, but had panicked about what to buy Levi. If it was too showy, Levi would be furious at him, but eighteen was important and Levi had become so important to Erwin. In the end, he had purchased a gift voucher after gentle input from Hange. He hadn’t wanted to explain to his father, and he wouldn’t have known what size to purchase, so he left the voucher in a nondescript greetings card.
When Erwin’s father left to see to the kitchen, Erwin crouched down to where Levi was sitting on the floor, hands folded neatly over the card, holding it close to his chest. He rested his hand on Levi’s shoulder, squeezing down lightly.
“They do binders. I know you— I know you would only want useful things. This would be useful for you.”
Levi had said nothing, just nodded, but pressed the card to his chest.
Afterward, Levi insisted on helping in the kitchen for the food prep, as pale-faced as he was after Erwin’s gift, which left Erwin to man the tiny destructive four-year-old running about the place, tearing through the candy canes delicately balanced on the Christmas tree in the corner of the living room. He calmed her down eventually, introducing her to the saccharine sweetness of Christmas movies. She sat enthralled, cuddling up with the new Ariel doll Levi had saved up for, as they waited for the food.
Erwin and his father spent most of the dinner talking to each other; literature and politics mainly, as Levi coaxed Isabel into eating at least the potatoes on her plate, filled up as she was with Christmas candies. Every so often, Erwin would look up to see Levi staring at him, grey eyes flickering in the warmth of the low lighting.
“He’s very young,” his father said, when Levi had taken Isabel away for a bath before bed. They could hear the faint, high-pitched whining from the floor above as they sat in the kitchen, drinking eggnog spiced a little too heavily, just the way they liked it.
“Eighteen today,” Erwin reminded him.
“You ought to be careful, Erwin.”
“We’re not—” Erwin started, laughed at the absurdity of his father thinking him low enough to sleep with a minor. “Dad, we’re not sleeping together. He’s just a friend and you’re the one that insisted I bring him.”
“I see that. I hear that.” His father nodded his head, though his expression remained serious. “Still, he is very young. Too young to have a child that age.”
“I’m not going to judge and I haven’t asked,” Erwin warned.
“No, but you’re an adult, Erwin. You are his support system. You’ll need to remain his support system. If you confuse your boundaries with him, it may not work out in any direction for the two of you.”
“I have no problem with boundaries. I feel free when I’m with the two of them. They make it easier. Or kinder.” He felt embarrassed saying so, for speaking vulnerably. He drained his eggnog and rested the glass down on the table.
Erwin’s father opened his mouth, and quickly closed it again, lips pinched as his fingers scraped through his short beard. “Be careful of each other.”
Erwin never told Levi about his father’s warning, didn’t want to make things uncomfortable and any unease that set in after they’d finished talking dissipated when Levi crept into his bedroom after lights out. Isabel had passed out asleep in the bedroom next door, surrounded by new toys.
They laid side by side on the bed, Levi’s hands folded neatly and resting on his stomach, his dark head a whisper away from touching Erwin’s shoulder. “I usually hate Christmas, but it hasn’t been so bad this year.”
“No?”
“Not bad at all. Your dad’s nice. I liked the lights and being, you know, involved.”
“I liked involving you.”
“Stop sucking up,” Levi said, and Erwin heard him roll his eyes even if he didn’t look down to see. “Thanks, I guess. For the gift. You didn’t have to do that.”
“No, but I wanted to.”
“If I find out you invited me because you felt sorry for me, I’m gonna kick your ass. I’ll kick you outta your own damn home,” Levi said. Erwin was sorry for the things he presumed had happened, but didn’t pity him.
Levi was Levi, simple as that and terribly complicated at the same time. Erwin loved him for it, for his ability to stand his ground no matter how deep the waters rose around him. That he stood up for Erwin no matter what, that he took him home and cooked him pasta if he thought Erwin was too stressed to do anything else.
“Then it’s a good thing I don’t pity you then,” Erwin said eventually, with enough time passed that Levi huffed at him, rolling onto his front. With his arms crossed and his cheek resting upon them, he looked soft. Levi rarely looked soft. Erwin place a hand on the back of his head, scruffing the short hair. Levi’s eyes closed, content as a cat.
“Did your dad ask if we were fucking?”
“A little more politely than that.” Erwin stared up at the ceiling, where the white paint had faded to a dull grey, where he still had glow in the dark stars pressed into vague formations. “He was concerned because you’re young.”
“Not underage anymore. You could put your hands on me and not go to prison.”
“Levi.”
“Joking. Jesus, don’t get so antsy,” Levi said. His head hadn’t shifted from where Erwin was cupping it gently, so Erwin didn’t move either. “You know you didn’t have to do that shit with the gift. I know how much they cost. It’s like you don’t have friends or shit.”
“I have friends,” Erwin said, moving his hand from Levi’s hair, but only because he rolled onto his side so they were facing each other. Levi stared up at him, cheeks squished into his arms, soft hair fanning over his forehead. “Not many. Hange says it’s because I’m too intense. I like to treat them well. And you only turn eighteen once. You act as if you haven’t had gifts before.”
Levi didn’t answer, just stared at Erwin blankly.
“Wait — have you never—”
“Of course I’ve had gifts before, shithead. Shitty donations to the group home,” Levi shrugged, smile fading into a frown. “Uncle Kenny gave me twelve dollars when I turned ten. Took it back a half hour later as an IOU.”
Erwin wanted to stare at Levi until he fell asleep, but decided that kindness was better than intensity. “I want you to enjoy this time, but if it’s too much, please let me know and we can go home.”
“I don’t want to go home. I like it here. It feels like some all-American movie set, even if your dad is sending my kid home with cavities.” Levi was often honest, but usually about the things that others felt it polite to keep to themselves. Erwin smiled faintly, eyes falling shut with a heaviness brought on by affection.
They spent the rest of the holidays together, and once Levi had spent enough time around Erwin’s father, he allowed him to take Isabel down to his store, where he promised a cavern of rare antiques to rival Ariel’s. She had squealed in delight, and Levi had looked concerned until the car pulled out from the drive and Erwin coaxed him back into the house, to finally watch a movie together without a little girl interrupting them.
“Dad’s desperate for you to come back next year,” Erwin said, as they crashed on the couch. Levi bundled up in a hoodie, hands bunched in the pockets. His face was pink, like he was too hot. A rarity because he usually ran cold. For a moment Erwin thought about stretching his arm along the length of the couch, but he didn’t want to ruin this, didn’t want to frighten Levi away. It was better, he thought, to enjoy the moment exactly as it was.
Chapter 4
First Love
Erwin bumbled through his modules; one year left before he graduated and then he would, providing he passed the bar, make it as a fully fledged lawyer.
Those were the thoughts that kept him up at night, that kept his stomach frazzled because boy, did he feel like he was leaving something behind. Distractions were hard to hold on to for very long. It had been girls in college; pretty blondes and redheads, psychology students often. Mike had found it funny. Erwin’s idea of pillow talk had been swapping theories with them until they tried to find excuses to leave.
But now when his head was fried from the anxiety of it all, he would go to Levi’s place of work, or his apartment, and spend time with him instead. Levi would call it bothering, but he liked it. Erwin could tell.
“You look like shit,” Levi said. He had two jobs and worked overtime where childcare allowed. His eyes were shadowed with lack of sleep, but he brushed off Erwin’s concern as he slid into the booth.
“Hey, you hardly look decent yourself,” Erwin said, pouring a hearty spoonful of sugar into his coffee. It smothered the burned taste a little better. “Why aren’t you sleeping?”
“I live with a five-year-old and I have bills to pay and shit to save up for,” Levi said. For a moment, the charade slipped, and he looked exhausted and terribly young beneath the bravado. “My doc says I can start looking into T soon, but my insurance demands I’m on it for a year before I think about surgery. Which is whatever. Gives me a chance to save. Need money.”
Levi continued with his group-therapy sessions on a Tuesday, even when he aged out of care. They were free, was his excuse, and you could go until you were twenty-one, was another reasoning. He complained about them incessantly, but never stopped attending. He’d come back from his sessions, where Erwin might be reading through the stack of unicorn themed books Isabel had pilfered from the library, or having a tea party with the toy tea-set Levi had picked up from a thrift store. Or listening to Isabel gabble on about fairies and vampires and witches. Or as of the last time, tearing scrap pages from the back of textbooks and letting her design sparkly monsters with the scented gel pens he grabbed at the dollar store on his way over.
One night, Levi had a party with his little group. A group of them were getting surgery within the same week and wanted to celebrate it. Levi said he didn’t want to go, but was anyway, mostly because Erwin insisted he should. He was still a kid, really, and should do things like that to celebrate.
Erwin and Isabel saw him off, with his hands bunched in his pockets and his shoulders hunched in as he left the apartment. Isabel was a little snotty with the final dregs of a cold, but she was happy drawing at the table; red hair as much of a mess as normal, her tongue sticking out as she dutifully coloured outside the lines. She fell asleep early, face down onto her drawings, and Erwin carried her to the one bedroom in the little apartment, tucking her doll in beside her, leaving the nightlight on, with the door slightly ajar.
When Levi came back to the apartment a half hour later, he had an electric aura abut him. His hair lank and sticking to his cheekbones, his eyes flickering around the room, drawing out threats even if there were none there. When he pulled his shaking hands from his pockets, Erwin could see bloodied knuckles still shining wet.
“Got kicked outta the group,” Levi said when Erwin approached. He held out his own hands, and Levi dutifully placed his own within them. He’d hit something or someone, bashed the skin raw, yet he flinched when Erwin rolled his thumb gently below his knuckles, just to feel if they were broken.
“Did you get into a fight?” Levi didn’t have any marks on him, but he was small and quick, and feisty enough to throw hands when he felt he needed to. Erwin had seen him in action before.
Levi shrugged and moved from Erwin’s grip. He pulled out the first aid kit from beneath one of the kitchen cupboards, placing it on the freshly cleared plastic table.
“Sit down, Levi. I’ll do it,” Erwin said, using just enough firmness that Levi’s eyes flickered up to him and he settled. Levi sat down, his shoulders still shaking. Erwin didn’t think he was close to crying, but there was something alarming about the friction in his body, the way his eyes bounced around the room. How he flinched hard when Erwin dropped into the seat beside him with a bowl of clean water and a fresh cloth.
Levi held his small hand out and allowed Erwin to clean up his knuckles, petting softly until the crusted blood slipped away, revealing the shiny fresh grazes. They weren’t broken, just bruised.
“Some people brought friends with them,” Levi said quietly. “One of them had been staring all night, and I wasn’t paying attention, but I went outside for a smoke and he cornered me. I don’t like being cornered.”
Erwin soaked in Levi’s words, taking the time to gentle soak Levi’s knuckles in the antiseptic ointment that ought to have him hissing, but just had him scrunching his face up slightly instead.
“What do you mean by cornered?”
“Tried it on,” Levi said. “Said he’d been told I had a kid, like that made me easy. I’m not fuckin’ easy. I showed him.” Levi sniffed, pulling his hand away when Erwin finished wrapping gauze around it. He would be fine. Erwin was more concerned with Levi’s mental state. He hadn’t seen him so rattled before.
“Did he try to force you?” Erwin asked quietly.
“Force me?” Levi scoffed. “He put his hand on my ass and I told him no, he did it again and I put him out on his back. Violence goes against the rules though, or some shit. The group leader was there. Said I can’t come back ‘cause it’s a safe space.”
“I’m sure if you explained—”
“I’m not explaining shit.”
Erwin stood at Levi’s harsh words, washed his hands in the sink and placed the first aid kit back where Levi had pulled it from. He turned, leaned against the kitchen counter and watched Levi sitting with his head bowed, his shoulders turned inwards, hands limp on the table.
“What’s the matter?” Erwin asked, trying for gentleness, hoping the sincerity came across.
“I don’t want any of them touching me. Not like that. I don’t like it.”
Erwin knew little about Levi’s background. Levi had told him so little, but inferences could be made and he nodded his own head in understanding. He took the few steps toward him, bending down so that he was kneeling in front of Levi’s chair.
“You’re about the only person I tolerate touching me.” Levi said. “Don’t ask me why.”
“Yeah?” Erwin’s stomach flipped. He hoped it didn’t show.
“Yeah.” Levi sniffed, wiping his nose with the back of his hand. “Plus, I’d rat you out to your dad if you tried anything. Piss your pants for sure at getting into trouble with daddy.”
“All right,” Erwin laughed, catching Levi’s eye beneath his curtain of dark hair.
It wasn’t exactly as if Levi had announced his feelings for Erwin, or maybe he had. He’d said Erwin was the only person he could tolerate touching him, and Erwin’s heart had done a flip with his stomach at the words, even if he had tried to swallow them down.
He rationalised to himself, and then quietly to a stoned Moblit, that it was okay, that his feelings for Levi were fine because they hadn’t come on until Levi was eighteen. And he would not act on them because it wouldn’t work. Levi found him annoying more than anything.
They were sitting in the living room of the small apartment; Hange conked out and snoring across the length of the couch. Mike was at work and Erwin was pacing as Moblit followed his movements with lazy eyes.
“If he found you that annoying, would he really let you babysit every Tuesday?” Moblit had said with glazed eyes, and charcoal stained fingers.
“Technically, I don’t have to anymore.” Levi had a phone call the morning after his fight, where the group leader confirmed again that he could no longer attend unless he entered into six sessions of anger management. Levi had scoffed, sworn and hung up on them. Still, Erwin had shown up every Tuesday after, and they’d spend the evenings together.
“But you’re still going there tonight, right?” Moblit said, “maybe you should tell him how you feel.”
“Perhaps you should stick to a better strain,” Erwin warned him. Moblit just shrugged, sucking down with his eyes falling heavy.
Levi and Isabel were having an indoor picnic when Erwin showed up. In reality, it was because it was the end of the month and money was tight, and Levi only had random items left in the refrigerator to see them through. He’d messaged Erwin about it, who had picked up a selection of jelly-filled donuts on his way over.
“Who eats donuts at a picnic?” Levi said, frowning. He’d pushed the couch back and spread an old pink blanket on the wider stretch of flooring. Isabel was on her stomach with her Ariel doll and plastic tea cups, yellow-socked feet kicking up behind her. Levi had plated up small sandwiches, apples sliced as thin as possible, cubes of cheese and crackers on miss-matched plates sitting in the centre of the blanket. Isabel was in the midst of force feeding Ariel a dry cracker and ignoring the two of them as Levi crouched to pour tea from a steaming teapot into two teacups. Isabel had juice in hers and looked up cautiously as if she expected Levi to ruin hers.
“I’ve never had an indoor picnic,” Erwin mused, sitting with his legs beneath him, back against the couch.
“Fuckin’ missing out,” Levi told him, handing a sandwich to Erwin, who took it with a nod of his head. “Mom used to throw them when she was alive. It wasn’t always safe to go out, so she’d throw indoor tea parties for us. She put a tablecloth over the bolted down table and we’d huddled underneath. It was probably shit, but that’s not how I remember it.”
“That sounds nice,” Erwin said. “How old were you when she passed?”
“Dunno. Young,” Levi shrugged, shutting the conversation down. He never talked of his mother, had barely mentioned his uncle. “What about your mom?”
“I was six. I find it hard to remember her face. It seems distorted from the person I see in photos. Then dad was sick not long after and left the family business. I suppose it all got muddled.”
“And now they’re all waiting with bated breath for you to save the Smith family of lawyers.”
“Something like that,” Erwin said, taking a too large bite from his sandwich. Levi stared up at him, only frowning slightly.
They ate the sandwiches and the fruit with quiet conversation, Isabel chatting away to her doll. Levi had never been much of a talker, even when Erwin could talk for days when compelled. He stared at Levi’s profile every so often, the way he sat with his head bowed, dark hair falling forward as always.
“I could — if you wanted, I could help you write a letter to the people that run the group. Explain the situation. I’m sure they would let you come back,” Erwin offered. Levi wasn’t illiterate; could read okay, but avoided writing things down, embarrassed at his rudimentary spelling. Erwin had always been excellent at convincing people to change their minds.
“Don’t bother. I prefer it here with you two” Levi shrugged one shoulder, sipping on his tea.
Naturally, five or so minutes later, Isabel was eyeing up the donuts that Erwin had bought, and Levi relented, cutting one in half, so the bright red jelly spilled out among the glittering dough. Isabel ate it on a plastic plate, sulking only a little when Levi told her to stop smearing the sugar over Ariel’s plastic face.
Levi ate the rest of Isabel’s donut, and Erwin ate two full ones. With the food scattered onto half finished plates and Isabel’s sugar high quickly plummeting into a crash, she climbed onto Levi’s lap, rubbing her face against his chest as her eyes closed. Erwin moved to clear up as Levi rocked his daughter to sleep.
Erwin packaged up the fruit and sandwiches into separate containers, stacking them into the refrigerator. He drained the teapot and left it on the side for Levi to deal with properly. By the time he turned around, Levi had taken Isabel off to her bedroom and Erwin took the time to pick up the discarded mermaid doll, wiping her sticky plastic smile down with a damp cloth.
By the time Levi was back, Erwin had cleared the blanket completely and was folding it up, squaring up the edges so they were straight. He left it dangling over the edge of the couch, helping Levi reposition the furniture back into place.
“You don’t have to stay,” Levi shrugged, when everything was back in good order. He’d probably want to clean the kitchen to his own standards, rather than Erwin’s, but he didn’t seem to care for it just now.
“I like spending time with you two,” Erwin said, firm in his insistence. “I thought we could watch a film, maybe. If you like?”
Levi’s eyes widened, just a fraction. “All right.”
Levi had limited choice in entertainment. Nearly all his owned DVDs were cartoons for his daughter, and he had limited TV channels. Still, they found a marathon of an eighties military show, just entertaining enough to keep them glued, just easy enough for them to talk over.
Levi’s couch was small. Erwin had noticed it before, but he noticed even more now; he took up at least half of it, and Levi had folded himself into the space beside him, so that his knees pressed to Erwin’s thighs. It wouldn’t be much to drop the arm stretched over the length of the couch down a fraction, so it curved around Levi’s small shoulders instead.
“Why are you making yourself so miserable?” Levi asked, breaking Erwin’s debate about where to place his arm. He left it where it was on the couch and dipped his head down, to where Levi was looking up at him with a frown.
“What do you mean?”
“What do you think I mean, asshole.” Levi poked Erwin’s side — hard — unnecessarily so. “You shouldn’t be some smalltime lawyer in some shitty-ass law firm. You should do more than just teach.”
“I want to teach.”
“You could do that if you like,” Levi counteracted. Erwin thought he had a look on his face that suggested he regretted this. “I like your dad, Erwin, but you’re not an extension of him. You should do what you want to do. You have opinions and shit. People would listen to you.”
“Maybe I’ll evaluate my options when I've graduated.” Touched as he was by Levi’s words, he dropped his arm down, curling it around Levi’s shoulders. Levi froze for a moment, and Erwin remembered perhaps too late that Levi didn’t like to be touched. That he had become violent the last time someone had. He moved to lift it away, but Levi reached out, clamped cold fingers around Erwin’s wrist and pulled it over his shoulder again.
“You’re allowed to touch me,” Levi said, leaning his head into the bend of Erwin’s elbow. Erwin looked down at him, saw Levi looking up and felt a tug of something, a pull within his heart that Levi was looking at him so cautiously. “I like having you touch me.”
He learned more of Levi over the coming weeks, as they grew closer in different ways. The little things, like how Levi hated punk music even though he wore the shirts. Punk was for whiny rich kids with no issues, he said, but the t-shirts were usually black and easy to pick up secondhand.
He grew up in Louisiana, lived in a trailer park with his mom. When she died, they moved him into his uncle’s trailer, where he lived until Kenny was arrested and Levi was shipped off to foster care. He unfurled his history as they lay together on Levi’s bed; a rainy afternoon a half-hour before Levi needed to pick Isabel up from Pre-K.
“They weren’t all bad. I was bad. I was fuckin’ nasty and violent. Kenny told me I had to be if I wanted to survive, ‘cause otherwise I’d end up dead like mom. Before I had Izzy, I would fight my way through life. I was smoking weed and skipping whatever shithole school they dumped me in, hanging out with deadbeats. Bounced around shitty fosters, but when I was thirteen I got moved into this nice home. They were old, like sixties or whatever. Kind, you know? They had a magnolia tree in the garden. Never seen one before. They were strict, a bit churchy, but they never forced it on me and they straightened me out, I guess. Convinced the state to let them homeschool me so I could catch up.”
“What happened?”
“I was pregnant before I moved there. Didn’t find out right away… but when we found out, they said they didn’t have the capacity or means for a newborn so I had to go.” Levi was picking at his nail, pushing down the cuticles in a way that looked painful. Erwin didn’t stop him, just laid beside him, listening. “I begged them not to send me away. That I’d be good or whatever. It’s — then I got moved again. Out of state and into a group home with a bunch of teenage parents. New school. They used to call the home the local whorehouse.”
“I’m sorry.”
“It wasn’t so bad. I got my own room with a lock. Childcare when I was supposed to be at school. I was way too behind, so I dropped out, but got jobs here and there and they were too busy to give a fuck. Sometimes I think Izzy would’a done better adopted out, but I couldn’t… I fought so hard to make sure they wouldn’t take her, you know? I became good. I tried to be good, not get into trouble.”
“You’re a good dad, Levi.”
“Maybe.”
Levi was frowning, his hands bundled into his lap. Erwin rolled onto his side, pushed his hair back so that he could see his face properly. Levi bumped into his palm, rubbing against him like a cat. The sorrow was old, a life he had lived and survived.
“You could go back to school,” Erwin suggested, to which Levi stopped play-bumping with him and gave him a haughty expression, the tip of his tongue rolling over his sharp teeth before he huffed. “I could help, if you liked.”
“Tch. ‘Course you would. Wanna role-play some teacher/student you should just say so, that’s about as much as you’re getting from me academically,” Levi hissed, but his hand fell down over Erwin’s chest, almost hesitant at first, before it slipped around Erwin’s ribs, pulling him close, leaning in so they were almost cheek to cheek.
“The offer stands,” Erwin said, cupping his hand against Levi’s face again. He filled it with his delicate features, his eyes feline, face a little flushed from the proximity. He still managed a sneer, despite everything.
“Whatever.”
Erwin would meet Levi whenever he could over the following weeks. Walking the two of them back from work, his knuckles brushing Levi’s. Sometimes Levi would invite him in, sometimes he didn’t. Every time he said goodnight with a kiss dropped on his lips.
They never spoke about what they were exactly, and not much changed, but the Tuesdays were their special evenings. When Isabel was asleep, they’d put something on the TV and curl up on the couch. Sometimes they’d hold hands.
Levi was small. So fucking small. He could fill the leftover space on the couch, curl up against Erwin’s side with his legs over Erwin’s lap, warming himself up. Levi never mentioned their difference in size, apart from to chide Erwin for taking up too much space, but still he plastered himself to Erwin’s side, burying his face down into the soft fabric of Erwin’s shirt.
“You can sleep over,” Levi said quietly, looking flustered at his own words as the credits ran up the screen. Erwin had been bracing himself to leaving the warmth of Levi’s home, getting in his car and falling back into reality. Instead, he looked down at Levi, who shrugged, as if it had meant nothing.
“Are you sure?”
“Yeah.”
Levi stood up quickly, catching himself from stumbling and slipped his hand into Erwin’s, pulling on it until he too lifted from the couch. It was only a few steps from the couch to the other side of the screen, Levi’s small bed half-hidden from view. There was something so consuming about Levi, a puzzle he couldn’t quite work out, attractive in a way he had refused to think about for so long, until it bubbled up over the surface.
They moved behind the screen, and his hands fell to Levi’s hips, fingers folding over the narrow width of them, thumbs falling into the grooves. Levi shuddered under the touch, swaying almost before his hands moved to Erwin’s chest, sliding upward until they wrapped around his neck, pulling him down for a kiss.
They moved quickly after that. Levi was a sharp kisser, all bite and it was awkward having to stoop so low, having to bend his knees, knowing that Levi was stretching up as well.
The last person he had slept with had been a girl he had interned with last semester. She was called Ebony and had brown glossy hair down to her hips and lips that tasted sticky with vanilla gloss. She had known exactly what she wanted every time they met, and Erwin had fallen into formation every time. Levi’s lips were a little chapped, and he felt inexperienced beneath Erwin’s hands. He kissed a little too sharply, leaving a sting over Erwin’s lips. Erwin pulled away, kisses falling sidewards, from the corner of Levi’s mouth, down his jaw, until he sucked against Levi’s pulse, feeling the flickering beat against his lips, quicker and quicker, his breath shuddering.
His hand moved lower, seeking the warmth between his legs. Erwin was good with his mouth, had been complimented on it many times in the past, and wanted to show off to Levi. His kisses moved inwards again, catching Levi’s probing tongue into his mouth, sucking on it as his hand rubbed in gentle circles over Levi’s stomach, sliding down just as they broke for breath. Levi’s lashes fluttered against him, his body shaking in Erwin’s arms. He’d frozen as Erwin had palmed his crotch and Erwin broke away when he saw Levi flinch.
“Levi, what’s the matter? Is this okay?” Erwin asked, dropping his hand and stepping back. Levi looked dazed, eyes clouded with lust, face pink, even as his body seemed to pull rigid. He sat down on the edge of his bed, Erwin standing up over him.
“I want to. I just—I haven’t been with anyone since Isabel was born.”
They hadn’t spoken of Isabel’s other father, or any experience either of them had. Really, they had gone from more than friends to this level of intimacy in far less time than Erwin had expected. He hadn’t really thought about it at all until they were doing it.
Erwin crouched down in front of Levi, waiting until he looked at him before smiling.
“We were moving quickly. It’s okay. We can take it slow.”
“You don’t mind?” Levi said it so softly, surprise catching in the back of his throat and softening his tone. Erwin pressed his lips onto to his forehead, a gentle kiss.
“As long as I still get to kiss you,” Erwin asked, frowning when Levi hunched in on himself, sitting back further on the bed.
“It’s not — I want to —” Levi’s face was red, and he was almost shaking as he pulled his body up, knees to his chest, chin resting down upon it. “With you I feel — my feelings for you or—I like you a lot. Whatever that means.” Erwin had an idea what Levi was trying to say and felt dizzy with the idea of it. Strange that anyone could really feel that way about him, let alone Levi, who was kind and complicated and beyond anything Erwin had ever known before.
Erwin offered an olive branch. “We don’t have to do anything you’re not comfortable with.”
“I want to do it with you,” Levi said quietly. “Eventually.”
Erwin was hardly disappointed, even if Levi still looked on somewhat embarrassed — either by his admission of feelings or that he was unable to perform.
“Do you want me to go?” Erwin offered, keeping any of his own feelings out of it. Levi wasn’t quite shaking now, but he looked pale and unwell.
“I want you to stay.”
“Good, because I want to stay,” Erwin said, and he rested his hand on top of Levi’s, curling it around where his fingers huddled around his own legs.
So he did. He stripped down to his boxers and t-shirt and turned away as Levi did the same and then they curled up in the bed, behind the screen separating Levi’s bed from the rest of the living space. He pressed up behind Levi, breathed in the scent of him, pressed a kiss to his shoulder and wrapped an arm over him, smiling when Levi’s hand settled on top of his own.
He fell asleep behind Levi and awoke only in the early hours when Isabel came stumbling into view, seeking the warmth of her father’s arms after a bad dream. Erwin pressed himself back against the wall to give the two of them more space and felt back asleep to the whispered sounds of Levi soothing his daughter’s whimpers.
++++
Erwin woke up alone in his childhood bed. The sheets crumpled, but cool beside him and his head barely throbbing as it had every other morning. He used the bathroom, brushed his teeth and ambled down the stairs, trying to fight the memories flooding his mind of the years lived in this house.
He found Levi half dressed, hair tucked behind his ears and out of his eyes for once. He poured a mug of black coffee; Erwin’s favourite blend. There was a cup of amber tea sitting half-drunk on the table.
“Morning,” Levi said as he looked up. He pulled Erwin in with a hand on his hip, laid a soft kiss on his mouth and pressed the coffee into Erwin’s welcoming hand. The way Levi was looking at him, all soft and sweet, or as sweet as he got, sent a specific shiver down his spine.
“Good morning, Levi,” he said, voice sounding hoarse. His jaw felt a little stiff from where he had worked at Levi the night before.
“Remember anything?”
“I remember last night,” Erwin said, and he bent his head down, kissed Levi softly, trying to ignore the disappointment that registered at the corners of Levi’s mouth. “Thank you.”
“Thank me for what? You did all the work.” Levi pushed away, moving back to the griddle on the hob. He was serving up waffles, fresh with a homemade batter. He used to serve waffles to Isabel every Saturday when she was a kid. Erwin remembered coming over to the sweet sticky smell of syrup, of Levi picking at his own, at dumping the leftovers on Erwin’s plate because he knew he’d always eat mountains. How Isabel squealed with delight when Levi chased her around the room, trying to clean her sticky fingers and face when she was done.
They sat and ate waffles together once they were cooked, or predictably, Levi picked at half of one and piled the rest up on Erwin’s plate. Levi sat close to him, so that their socked feet touched beneath the table. Erwin swallowed down his coffee and smiled, remembering the look on Levi’s face the night before, when he came with Erwin’s tongue and fingers inside him.
After breakfast, Levi moved on to dust down the living room, and Erwin found sanctuary in his father’s office. It was barren of books; and while he knew they were safe and cherished in his home with Levi, it brought on a grief he hadn’t known had been sitting in his chest.
He sobbed into his hands, at the weight of his missed father, catching the damp and wiping it back over his face, pressing his palms against his swollen eyes. If his father was alive, what would he say? Would he be pleased about his marriage to Levi? He had loved him like a son, taken to him quickly despite his words to Erwin, despite his thoughts that the relationship would fail if Erwin didn’t put the brakes on it.
“Enough now,” Erwin said to himself. He touched the ring he wore under his shirt and sniffed one last time before standing.
Erwin’s eyes were no doubt still red when he found Levi ten minutes later, but he seemed pleased that Erwin wanted to leave the house and quickly dressed, throwing Erwin the car keys to drive them into town.
“What were the deleted messages?” Erwin asked. Levi was sitting opposite him in a little coffee shop that used to be the menswear store Erwin had suffered through a mind-numbing week of work experience when he was sixteen. The hollowed crevices, where mountains of jeans used to sit in their designated size cubbies, now became where they sat on a creaking leather couch. Erwin couldn’t stomach any more caffeine, so they drank cold sodas together.
“What deleted messages?”
“On my phone. There were three deleted messages from you.”
Levi flushed, and his lips pushed out into a gentle pout. His grey eyes averted Erwin’s deliberately, skirting the coffee table instead. “You were in a coma. I had shit I wanted to say to you because I wasn’t going to say it to your comatose body. But then they said you were coming around and I didn’t want you seeing that.”
Erwin was relieved. He’d thought maybe there was some godawful revelation Levi was hiding from him. “That you love me?”
“Well, it was probably badly spelled and Izzy knows your PIN and I didn’t want her finding out and using it as collateral damage.”
Erwin felt hazy with affection again. Levi’s love for him had felt blinding in the past. He hadn’t really known how to deal with it when Levi had shown it, so Erwin had pushed him away. Again and again. Now it was his to hold close to his chest, to reflect back to him.
“I always loved you,” Erwin said, hoping that Levi understood how much. “I’m glad I finally found the courage to send it back your way.”
Levi’s eyebrows creased again. They did that more these days, even if the rest of his face stayed relatively flat. The gold and green of his wedding band sparkled every time he lifted his glass to his mouth.
“Stop being soft, old man,” Levi said. “I don’t like it.”
The drive home had been quiet. He could feel his own mood sinking, at the thought of leaving the solitude of his childhood home, of living back with Levi, in that house he had no connection to. When they finally made it through their front door, Erwin finally met Furlan for the first time. Not the first time, he reminded himself. The pungent waft of nail polish filtered through the house as he followed Levi through the small hallway to the kitchen.
There was a tall blond boy, around Isabel’s age, with large blue eyes and a floppy haircut designed almost deliberately to fall into his eyes. His hands held awkwardly on the tabletop, coated in a glossy black. Isabel was painting her toenails in a matching shade, foot propped up on the ridge of the table as she worked.
“Hi Levi,” the man said. “Hi Mr Smith.”
“Mr Smith? It’s Erwin, Furlan,” Levi said, stopping short enough that Erwin stumbled into him. Suddenly touching Levi felt odd again, in this house that didn’t feel like a home to him, in front of his step-daughter, who he remembered mostly being pre-pubescent and cutesy.
Levi looked at him, tilted his head backwards, until silver met blue. The left corner of his mouth twitched, though the rest of him remained placid. “This is Furlan. Izzy’s roommate. He works at the tea shop. Did you see to the kids yesterday?”
“Yeah. The boy had a black eye. Apparently, some kids at school came at him,” Furlan said, after a dutiful nod in Erwin’s direction. Levi was listening aptly to the boy, but his eyes had drifted over to Isabel’s toes wiggling on the table. She dropped them to the floor with an eye roll before standing up.
“What about Gabi?”
“I’m guessing she scared them off,” Furlan laughed, and dropped his eyes down to his fingers, where he blew on the black paint.
“Hmmm.”
“Did you guys have a nice time?” Isabel asked, winding her arms around Levi’s middle and pulling him down into a hug. He went with it, folding her in and squeezing tight.
“I remember far more about my life in that house,” Erwin said, with a lighter tone than necessary. When Levi dropped his arms from Isabel, she pasted herself to Erwin instead. He held her lightly, remembering how she would fall asleep against his lap on the occasions he used to babysit. How she vomited in his lap that time he had given her too many candies behind Levi’s back.
“We did have a good time together,” Erwin said, letting her go when she wiggled free. She took that moment to stare at Levi, who ducked his head, heat rising. She threw back her head and laughed.
“You guys suck,” she said, wafting away. “Hey dad, can we crash here tonight? I Promise not to make a mess.”
“Yeah,” Levi smiled. Erwin could hear it even if it didn’t spread over his face. “I’d like that.”
Levi made lasagne for supper, in a huge square dish clearly designed to last for several meals. Furlan turned out to be a bright and cheerful young man, a few years older than Isabel, and calmer with it. Erwin could see why Levi enjoyed having him around his daughter.
Erwin was mostly silent, listening to the gentle back and forward of Isabel and her friend. Occasionally, Levi would interject a complaint. Erwin felt a stranger, wondered if they did this often. Did they spend Sunday evenings together, bickering lightly, with Isabel’s best friend happy to interject. What did Erwin bring to the table?
“What do I normally say on nights like that?” Erwin asked that night, when the kids were watching movies downstairs and Levi had sectioned the leftovers into carefully labelled containers and delegated them into the refrigerator. Now they were piled in the bed together, but Erwin felt less comfortable here. This wasn’t his childhood bed that he had countless memories of, but a bed he shared with a new life he had built with Levi.
Levi curled up against him, and Erwin rolled an arm over his shoulders, reminded himself this was the man he had adored for so long, the man he had reduced to a squirming pile of boneless moans only a day before.
“What do you mean?” Levi asked, fingers rolling in gentle circles over Erwin’s chest.
“I struggled to think of something to say.” Erwin stroked his fingers down the length of Levi’s shoulders, over muscle and bone. “Is it obvious?”
“A little.” Levi lifted, using his elbow on Erwin’s chest to brace himself. He looked down at Erwin once he sat a little higher, one of his small hands coming to cup the side of his face. “You like Furlan. You guys are good at tuning out when me and Izzy get too much and anyway, I think he likes blonds too, so I better watch out.” Levi rolled his shoulder and Erwin’s lips stretched into a gentle smile. Levi kissed at his mouth, just a small press of lips upon lips, the ends of his hair tickling Erwin’s nose until he leaned up to tuck it behind his ear. “I guess I’m sorry I was a dick earlier.”
“I’m sorry,” Erwin said, unsure what else he could offer.
“I love you. Go to sleep,” Levi said, falling onto the pillow, kicking out until he was folding around Erwin.
“Goodnight Levi.”
Mike had barely changed in the time Erwin had lost. That was one good thing about his old friend; he was unchangeable. He’d always been tall, not as charming as Erwin, but had better luck with the ladies when they were younger. Less clean-cut with his shaggy hair and scruff, easier to lead astray. Funnier and more carefree. His business degree and experience in managing gyms across the city had granted him the ability to run his own studio downtown. He was a success in his own right. Erwin was happy for him.
Mike pulled him into a hug when they pulled up outside the gym. He’d always been carefree, but so protective of Erwin when they had lived together. He explained on the drive over that he hadn’t a chance to get to the hospital when Erwin was first brought in, and had kept a distance once Levi had explained the situation.
“You don’t remember my CrossFit phase. I’m fucking pleased about that,” Mike said, as he gave a brief tour of the equipment they used before they set up.
It felt good working out; there was muscle memory and the burn in his muscles as he pumped was good. Helped push out the confusion and grief that’d been whirling around his brain for so long. Any residual anxiety about his feeling regarding his current life evaporated. The burst of endorphins as they recovered together in the juice bar was even better.
“So you remember nothing of the past four years?” Mike said, leaning back. The bar was filling around them, young mothers with children in strollers chattering away at tables not too far away. “That’s what Levi said when he messaged.”
“I remember leaving the house. Kissing my wife goodbye and then nothing. I woke up and Levi and I were—” he paused, studied Mike’s face for anything, though he gave nothing much away. “The last I remember with him was your wedding.”
“Yeah, you didn’t speak for a while after,” Mike said, scratching his head.
“You know why?”
Mike shook his head. “With your history, I can guess. You danced around each other for years. It was a matter of time.”
“He kissed me. I didn’t stop him — didn’t want to stop him, I suppose. He confessed his feelings hadn’t ever changed, and I told him to leave it alone. Went back to my life with Marie.”
Mike swallowed his water, looked down at Erwin from the length of his long nose. “It was never one sided. It’s why he pursued it over the years.”
“I loved him. Always did.”
“You loved Marie too,” Mike reminded him softly, and Erwin nodded. He loved Marie. She was good for him, they were good for each other. Everyone always said they looked good together. His dad said they fit well.
“Some things aren’t adding up.” Erwin felt like shit talking like this, but Mike would know, even if no one else did. “All I remember is loving my wife and now—?”
Mike’s eyes were hidden beneath his scruffy hair, but he lifted a shoulder in a shrug. “Like I said, Levi was always yours. He was there for you when your dad died.”
“Marie wasn’t?”
“She was. She tried to be, but I suppose it’s different,” Mike said, wiping his brow. Erwin's muscles tingled with a good ache; pushed harder than they had been in weeks. “He was a father to Levi, too. They stayed close.”
“I remember things here and there… hardly anything about our relationship apart from the miscarriage last year.”
“He told you?” Mike asked, and Erwin felt his ears burn as he scrubbed the back of his neck. “It wasn’t easy on either of you, I guess. Tough year.”
It was said gently, though Erwin knew Levi would bristle if he’d overheard. “I love him. I’ve always loved him, but I just need to know how we got to this place.”
“Brother, that’s something you’ll have to work out with him instead.”
They talked about easier subjects after that. Mike talked for what seemed like forever. About the programme with the inner-city kids. About Nana, and how in love with her he still was. The dogs; they had another rescue, a blond scruff that bore a striking resemblance to Mike from the photo he showed.
“I’ll see you Saturday for the game,” Mike said, pulling up outside the teashop as they said their goodbyes.
“The game,” Erwin responded, as if he understood, grinning when Mike’s laughter bubbled from his chest.
“Yeah yeah. Levi’ll explain.”
Erwin stared through the window as Mike pulled away. He could see a gathering of people huddled in the seats, drinking tea and laughing together. A young couple left as Erwin opened the door, and they waved to him, hands clasped together, a paper bag with the logo from the teashop swinging from the girl’s free hand.
“Hey Mr Smith,” they said in unison. He didn’t recognise them, but bowed his head all the same.
The shop smelled of warmed spice; cinnamon and nutmeg, something woodsy beneath it. Furlan was chatting excitedly to a girl at the register as Erwin walked in. He nodded his head, but continued chatting at length on his favoured blend of rooibos.
Gabi and Falco were sitting at the table closest to the back room, homework spread out over the table, with bowls of what looked like last night’s lasagne in front of them. The boy had a dark bruise under his left eye, but he nodded his head to Erwin in a polite manner.
Erwin walked to the back room to see Levi sitting at the little desk in the corner drinking tea. His grey eyes sparkled when he noticed Erwin, who felt a similar whoosh of familiarity. Levi stood, a not-quite smile pulling at his mouth as his arms reached out, sliding up and over Erwin’s forearms.
“Hey. How’d it go?”
“All right.” Erwin stroked Levi’s hair back, tucking it behind his ears, noticing the effect it had on Levi, how his eyes shuttered close, his head falling heavily into Erwin’s palms.
“I’m feeling the outcome of a hard workout,” he admitted, smiling when Levi pulled him in closer. Levi’s arms wrapped around his middle, resting in the small of his back, his nose pressed to the space below his pectorals. Erwin cupped his own hands to the back of Levi’s head, feeling the difference between the long silky strands and the soft undercut beneath. “Some parts he cleared up more than others.”
Levi made a noise in the back of his throat, Erwin felt it in the vibration in his chest. A content cat. Erwin laughed, didn’t share the joke, and dropped his arms to his sides when Levi pulled away.
“You guys never liked each other much,” Erwin said, remembered threads of memories from years before. Levi had been Erwin’s friend, shared spaces between them, but no genuine friendship between the two of them, like Levi had with Hange or Moblit.
“We both care for you,” Levi shrugged, turning his back on Erwin. He moved to the desk, where a pot of tea was steaming; the teapot was dark and heavy. Ornate and expensive. Erwin had a flash of buying it; of Levi’s face as he unwrapped the gift.
“I bought you that,” Erwin said, nodding toward the teapot, watching Levi pour out the dark tea into two matching teacups. There was a floral scent in the air, among the richness of the leaves. Levi handed him a cup and then beckoned him over to the small couch in the corner of the room.
“Yeah. A gift when I got this place. You knew I collected teapots, but you said this one was for me. For us.” Levi’s shoulders were up by his ears, but he calmed himself down with a gentle sip of tea. Erwin did the same and tried not to balk at the rose-scent of the tea.
“This is a little too fragrant for me,” he said, placing his cup down on the side.
“You never said so before,” Levi said. “You said it was your favourite.”
“I see.” Erwin blinked and tried to find a way out of the hole he had somehow landed in. “Perhaps my tastebuds have changed?”
“Maybe you just forgot how to lie,” Levi sighed. His face was pink, his lips a thin line as if Erwin had genuinely offended him. They sat in silence for a time, as Levi finished his tea. Part of Erwin wanted to finish his own, for how he had clearly disappointed Levi, but he knew that would only make things worse.
“The two kids are out front,” Erwin said, when he couldn’t stand the silence anymore. “You fed them?”
“Gotta make sure they eat more than just junk.” Levi appeared soothed by the change in conversation. Once he finished his tea, he placed the porcelain down gently beside Erwin’s full cup and turned toward him. “Falco’s looking thin. He’s growing like a reed. And Gabi’s getting into fights more and more.”
“Are they safe where they are?”
Levi shrugged. He would know more than Erwin. “Could be better. Could be a lot worse. They’re not fed enough. They’re not looked after, but that’s better than too much attention. Gabi is barely any younger than I was when I got knocked up. Isn’t that fucked up?”
“You were very young.”
Erwin had never seen photos and imagined none existed of Levi pregnant. They earliest he recalled was one he’d seen sitting on the mantlepiece in their home, and in every other house Levi had lived in. Levi, looking impossibly young with a black beanie tugged down over his dark hair and shock-white face, a newborn Isabel in his arms.
“When Izzy was twelve, she was using toilet cleaner to dye her Barbie’s hair.”
“Did it work?” Erwin asked, watching the way Levi’s eyes twitched just slightly. He took a seat beside Erwin again.
“No, it melted. I had to clean lumps of melted plastic from the basin. When she told her school friends, they laughed at her for playing with dolls still, but I appreciated it. That she was young. That bleaching her fuckin’ doll’s hair with my goddam cleaning supplies was at the forefront of her mind rather than anything else.”
At twelve, Erwin had been obsessed with Gracie McLean from his homeroom. He had acne, and a mouth filled with metal, pulling his teeth straight. It hadn’t been his best year.
“Perhaps Isabel could donate her old dolls to Gabi,” Erwin said. He stretched his arm out along the length of the couch and Levi rested against him. His hair smelled familiar, but he couldn’t quite recall if it was from years spent together, or simply the proximity of their touch in the past few days. It didn’t matter. Erwin thrived on the way Levi leaned against him, pulling affection from him.
“Nah. She wouldn’t give them up and Gabi’s not the type.”
They sat like that for a while, in companionable silence until Falco made himself known by shyly putting his head around the doorway. Levi had squirmed from Erwin’s arms at the sight of Falco, who quietly said he needed help with the grammar for a suspected pop quiz he was practicing for, and Furlan was still busy mooning over loose tea with the same person he’d been talking to when Erwin had walked in.
“You know I can’t spell for shit,” Levi had said, beckoning Erwin out there instead.
They were good kids, or Falco was. Gabi sat beside him, scowling at Erwin from beneath a heavy pair of brows. She looked both younger and older than her years. Erwin awkwardly wondered how often he had sat with them, but the fact they called him Mr Smith, rather than Erwin, seemed less about respect and more a sense of unfamiliarity.
Furlan had left not long after Erwin had taken to tutoring out front, and Levi had wrapped an apron around his neat waist, served customers in his clipped voice and mopped down tables the moment they were abandoned.
“Brats, you better get home,” Levi said eventually. He’d wrapped up some pastries and fruit into a cloth parcel and handed it to Falco, who gently placed it in the bottom of his rucksack before loading his books over the top.
Gabi was quiet. Erwin had noted that she barely spoke a word - that Falco nervously spoke for the two of them, though every so often he saw her glancing toward Levi, communicating with each other without speaking. He wondered if the old Erwin that loved and lived with Levi knew what it was about. He was too tired to ask anything more.
By the time they made it home, Isabel was back at her place with Furlan’s for the week, though she had made enough of a mess of the kitchen to send Levi cussing her out down the phone. Erwin made his way to the living room, pulled open some of his father’s old books - for the comfort in the familiarity than anything else.
They ate a simple meal of rice and vegetables. Levi served them beer from the fridge, an imported brand that Erwin remembered enjoying the summer he spent in Spain.
“Hange is getting desperate,” Levi said, pushing rice around his plate. The lighting was soft in the kitchen, dimmed low and flattering. It hollowed out his eyes, shielded the delicate features of his nose, his small mouth. “They really want to see you. Been blowing up my phone.”
“Yes, I would like to see them and Moblit. And um—”
“Pieck,” Levi provided, the gentle clink of his cutlery cutting through the conversation as he placed it down. “Did Mike say anything today?”
“He was cautious.” Erwin swallowed down a heavy gulp of beer. It sat in his stomach, full from his quickly demolished meal. “He gave little away. I hate having to ask people to fill in the blanks.”
“You can ask me,” Levi said, his eyes sparkling in the little light they had in the room. “I’ll tell you whatever you need to hear.”
“And Mike wouldn’t?” Erwin asked. He had known Mike longer, loved Mike longer. Never in the same way, but it was a brotherhood.
“He would, but I think we have different ways of seeing to you. I’m your husband. Remember that.” Erwin hadn’t told Mike he’d been seeing Levi back when they first went out. Mike had been respectful but found it odd, the friendship they had. Found Levi rude — which he was — but never insisted that they couldn’t hang out, just to be careful. “Was he not a fan of our marriage?”
Levi shrugged, “We don’t fight. He’s your best friend. Just wasn’t sure what he would say.”
Levi left to have a bath after supper, after Erwin’s insistence that he’d clean up the kitchen. He rinsed the dishes and loaded the dishwasher, wiped down the countertops. On the windowsill above the kitchen sink there was a photo of the two of them. Erwin had his arm over Levi’s shoulder, bringing him in to his chest; they were both in dark suits, Levi had a bundle of red roses held awkwardly to his chest, like he wasn’t sure what to do with them. Erwin had a flush on his cheeks, a smile on his face wider than he thought he’d ever given. He tried it out now, in the kitchen's nighttime darkness, but it made his jaw ache, felt fake.
Levi was still in the bath, the door open to their bedroom, when Erwin approached. His face hidden beneath a steaming face cloth placed over his face. The rest of his body hidden beneath white foam.
Erwin stood and stared at him, watched the slow rise and fall of his breath. He had loved Levi, even when he denied it to himself. He’d been cruel to push Levi further away, and yet, two years ago, something had changed - not Levi’s determination, but Erwin’s ability to admit the truth in the wake of his father’s death.
“Oi, stop staring at me, you fuckin’ mouth breather.” Levi’s voice stirred Erwin from his thoughts. He flinched when something wet slapped him across the mouth and looked down at the wet thud as the flannel slipped down from his face to his socked feet.
“How could I not,” Erwin said, bending to pick the face cloth up. The floor was clean — of course it was, but still Erwin didn’t dare dip the flannel back into the bath where he was still sprawled. He moved into the bathroom, rinsed it under the bathroom sink, ringed it, and then folded it neatly into a smaller square, leaving it to rest on the towel rack.
Levi had watched his every move with those silver eyes, free from the usual shielding his hair gave him. He’d pushed it back, baring his face. He was pretty. Erwin had always avoided the descriptor, unsure how Levi would feel about it, but the delicacy in his pointed features, his sloped cheeks and pointed chin, eyes clear and feline, could be described as nothing else.
“You’re beautiful,” Erwin said instead, crouching down beside the tub so they were eye level. Levi squirmed in the water, ducking down until his chin dipped beneath the surface. “Why are you hiding from me?”
“Do you mean it?” Levi asked quietly, voice small and damp in the air. Erwin cupped a hand to the base of his skull against wet hair. His other hand slipped beneath the water, curling around a slim thigh. The muscle tensed beneath his touch before softening.
“I’ve been wanting to ask what our first time together was like?” Erwin said, eyes on Levi, on his face even as his thumbs moved in unison, stroking gently over thigh and skull. Levi shivered, easily pulled apart by the dual movements.
“Our first time?”
“I ruined it before, I know,” Erwin said, moving forward and kissing Levi’s mouth. Levi slipped further down into the tub, eyelashes tickling Erwin as they batted against him. “You weren’t ready, and I left, but the second time. When I woke up.”
“We didn’t wait till we were married,” Levi said eventually, leaning in for another kiss, wet fingers curling to Erwin’s nape. “I wasn’t waiting for that.”
Erwin wondered half-heartedly about their wedding. It was small; he imagined. He had the big frothy one with Marie, and Levi would loathe that kind of thing. Just the two of them, a couple of witnesses. Levi’s kid.
Erwin helped Levi out of the bath, making a deliberate attempt at staring at his body, even when Levi tried to wrap himself up in a towel. The metal in his nipples, his small waist and narrow hips.
“When did you get these done?” Erwin asked, thumbing the left one as Levi tried to circle around him. Levi grabbed at his wrist lightly, just to touch. He was quickly turning to putty, already softened from his bath. Erwin drank in the sight of him, towel clutched high on his stomach as if Erwin hadn’t taken him apart with his mouth days prior, as if they didn’t share a marital bed together.
Levi had been shy before, when they first tried being together, but that had been different; he had a mountain of trauma and little experience. “Let me see you,” Erwin said, holding his hand out.
“Why?” Levi asked, but his eyes were widening, his shoulders rising and rolling a little quicker with his intake of breath. Levi worked out, and it showed in the ripple of muscles beneath his taut skin; pink and wet, drying in their warm bedroom.
“I don’t remember,” Erwin said. “I want you to show me how we first made love.”
“You’re always horny on Mondays,” Levi said, with very little heat. “It’s working out with Mike.”
“Don’t mention Mike right now,” Erwin said. He stepped forward, taking the initiative. He had been so stagnant with his lack of memory, but today his head ached a little less, and spending time with Levi at the teashop, listening to him talk about those two lost kids reminded him of how kind he had been in the past, beneath the gruffness. Remembered him staying up on the phone as Erwin panic-called him through the night, when he had papers to turn in. Remembered Levi constantly filling his mug with shitty coffee in that old all-night diner he used to work in.
He rested his hand on Levi’s hip, curled his fingers around. He was so small, even with the muscle. If he moved his other hand, he was sure they would meet in the middle. Instead, he moved his fingers down, past smooth damp skin until they met at where Levi had tied the towel. Their eyes met, and Erwin waited for Levi to shirk away, to hiss and send him from the room while he changed, but he didn’t. He just continued staring up at Erwin, blinking up at him, only closing his eyes when Erwin's fingers caught around the white towel, tugging it away from Levi’s body.
He had seen Levi last time, when he had used his mouth on him, but that had been in brief snatches, when his mouth and hands had travelled over him in a spike of passion.
He was lithe but well built; like he worked more on cardio than strength-building. His chest defined, the scars from his surgery faded into the seams of his body. He was hairless, more or less, and Erwin recalled Levi joking about that back when he first started on T, but there was a dark trail of hair starting just below his navel, leading down to the trimmed patch over his crotch.
“We did it here, in this bed. You were gentle, I guess,” Levi said flatly, hands twitching at his sides. He looked like he wanted to shield himself, never one to preen. Eventually, his arms lifted as he stepped up to Erwin. Levi reached only the centre of his chest, his hands moved; nimble fingers making quick work of alleviating Erwin from his shirt, until his hands slid beneath the fabric to warm skin.
“You guess?”
“You were gentle,” Levi said again, this time a little more breathless. “No one’s ever gentle, but you are.”
Erwin touched Levi, over the dark hair between his legs, then a little lower, over his growth, warm and hardening beneath his touch, then lower still, to where he was dampening.
“Did I touch you like this?” Erwin circled his index finger, stroking over Levi’s sensitive skin until the dampness increased and he released enough for his finger to slide inside.
Levi was so small that Erwin’s finger felt huge inside his body. He clung to him tight, his body clenching around his finger, his hands wrapping over Erwin’s elbows. When Erwin looked down, he saw Levi’s toes curling into the grain of the rug spread over the bare boards of their bedroom. He crooked his finger in a beckoning manner and Levi let out a keening noise, baring his throat to him.
“S-stop,” Levi said, puffing between breaths. Erwin laughed, stilled his finger from where he’d been relentlessly stroking. He pulled it from Levi’s body and sucked it into his mouth, tasting him on his tongue. “I’ll show you how we did it.”
Levi pulled Erwin from his clothes, letting them fall to the floor before he pushed him to the bed. Erwin laid back, stroking his cock with a slick hand once Levi threw a bottle of lubricant at him.
“All the foreplay in the world ain’t gonna get me wet enough,” Levi said as he climbed onto the bed. He crawled up from the base until he straddled Erwin, the tops of his feet resting over his thighs, sitting his ass down on his heels, hands braced in the center of Erwin’s chest. Erwin slid his hands up Levi’s waist, leaving a slick trail of lube up one side as he stared at the metal pierced through Levi’s nipples.
“Oi, did you hear me? A few things because you don’t remember shit,” Levi said, clasping a hand over Erwin’s on his waist, forcing him to look up. Levi’s hair was still pushed back, and it brought out all the delicate points of his face. Over his nose and cheeks, a fierce pink flush sat. “You’re hung and I’m tiny. We use a lot of lube and I still might bleed, but it’s okay, you don’t have to worry.”
“Shouldn’t I?”
“You do, but you shouldn’t,” Levi said. “You know the traffic light system?”
“Green good, red stop?” Erwin said, knowing enough, nodding when Levi confirmed it. Erwin had never much needed for safe-words in other relationships; having been a little more vanilla. “Are we kinky?”
“Sometimes.” Levi pressed their mouths together. It was deeper than expected, and Erwin groaned. He wanted Levi’s hand or his mouth on him. Something, even if the weight over his thighs was delicious. “It’s not that. It’s more complicated—I’m complicated. If I’m not stoned, you know, sometimes it’s harder for me.” He rested their heads together. Erwin’s hands moved up, stroking through Levi’s hair. It had started to dry and was soft beneath his fingers.
“Were you this bossy during our first time, or are you just dishing out the rules?” He asked, pressing his fingers into the pressure points at Levi’s nape and watching his dark lashes flutter closed. Levi wouldn’t want pity, he reminded himself. And they implemented a system to check in. They were healthy. It was good.
“You were too goddam cautious. Needed coaxing.” Levi leaned forward, shifted up so that his knees pressed into the outsides of Erwin’s thighs, sitting higher on him. Erwin’s hands slid down, curling over the length of Levi’s back, pulling him close enough to kiss.
Levi kissed with tongue, gentle but firm. The slick muscle pressing apart Erwin’s lips. His hands slid down as his lips moved against Levi’s, cupping his ass, squeezing it between his hands before his fingers slipped around, grabbed at his hips and pulled him in close. Levi didn’t let their lips part, even as he shifted over Erwin’s lap.
When they pulled apart, a strand of saliva linked them until Levi’s wicked tongue swiped at his own bottom lip. He ducked his head to look between them, where Erwin’s cock was semi-hard. Levi pumped out a portion of lube into the palm of his hand and greased up his fingers.
“Our first time you were nervous,” Levi said quietly, stroking his fingers almost absentmindedly up the length of Erwin’s cock. Girls had struggled with it, some of them just took the tip, or rolled it wet between their thighs. Levi was so small, smaller than Marie had been—
Erwin closed his eyes, willed away thoughts of his ex-wife.
Levi teased him, never tightened the grip. Just slippery friction.
“You didn’t know where to touch me. Where I’d want you.” Levi’s eyes flickered to Erwin and then away, almost coy if he realised it wasn’t shyness but embarrassment. Levi couldn’t get through one conversation without it turning awkward. Dirty talk wasn’t going to be an exception.
“Where did you let me have you?” Erwin prompted, one hand sliding up Levi’s side, thumb catching on the barbell through his left nipple. God, he was obsessed with them. Levi caught his hand, pulled on his fingers, straightening them out before he moved them down over his taut stomach, over faint stretch marks; silvery with age, down lower to the thatch of black curls, where he stood proud and pink. He lifted onto his knees so that he could move Erwin’s hand lower, to press where he was wet.
“Here.”
Erwin rolled his fingers, much as he had before, curling around until Levi loosened enough to let two of his fingers slide inside. He was deliciously tight, gripping onto him, not as wet as he’d thought, but that was a side effect. That was what the lubricant was for.
“How often can I make you come with just my fingers?” Erwin asked, bold enough to push when he felt a little resistance. He cupped Levi’s hip with his free hand. It slotted easily into his grasp. He could feel the heat from Levi’s small cock against the edge of his upward palm, as he writhed on his fingers.
“You like getting your dick wet too much. Yeah, like that,” Levi said, his thin brows scrunching together as Erwin fingered him. He was good at this, had fingered enough girls through college when they were too afraid for anything else and Levi wasn’t a girl — he’d always known that, but the mechanics were similar. He curled upwards, rolled his fingers against the nub inside Levi until he was panting, rocking down against his hand. “Goddamn Erwin. You wanted me to come on your cock, not your fingers.”
“Did you ride me?” Erwin asked, slipping his fingers free. He could smell sex lingering in the air, cloying and damp as it was. His cock throbbed where Levi was stroking it every so often, tightening his grip against the base whenever he got too excited.
“Yeah,” Levi nodded, grabbing the lube and squeezing some out onto Erwin’s palm, still resting beneath him. He was gentle as he slicked Levi up, pressing the lube against his hole before wiping the excess against his weeping cock. God, it felt good to fuck up into his palm. Levi’s nails biting into his chest were the only thing stopping him.
Levi spread himself open as he lifted onto his knees, shuffling until he was hovering over Erwin’s cock. “I’m green,” he said between clenched teeth as Erwin’s cock kissed where he was pink and dribbling. “What are you?”
“Green.” Erwin held his cock steady as Levi nodded, eyes flitting shut as he lowered himself down onto Erwin’s cock. He bounced gently for a little while, taking Erwin inch by inch. “Was it this intense?”
“You didn’t ask so many dumb fucking questions.” Levi’s eyes squeezed shut as he lowered himself down, losing himself to the inches of Erwin slowly pushing him wide. He felt fucking amazing. It looked fucking amazing, watching his girth disappear into Levi’s tight body. When he finally settled, Levi’s ass balanced lightly on his balls, and his folds were spread wide around his cock.
Levi’s throat was bared to him in a perfect arch and the metal piercings through each of his peaked nipples glinted in the warm lighting. Erwin held onto Levi’s narrow hips, aware of how his fingertips almost touched — would touch if he forced it.
“You’re beautiful.”
“We did it like this,” Levi said, ignoring the comment and shifting on Erwin’s lap, wincing when the movement jolted Erwin inside him. He seated himself fully on Erwin and wound his arms over his shoulders, wrapping his legs around Erwin’s waist until he was clinging to him with all four limbs. Erwin held him by his ass, squeezing his cheeks and using them as his momentum. Levi rocked, his body milking Erwin.
“You’re beautiful.” The words didn’t change, though the intent sounded different, deeper somehow, as his mind flooded with memories of Levi.
Erwin felt the solid weight of Levi in his arms, the press of heels against his tailbone as Levi writhed on his lap, gentle-gentle movements, sweaty in his arms as he puffed against him, cheek to cheek.
Erwin flipped them, lifted Levi up under his ass and turned until Levi was flat on his back beneath him. They detached in their movements, but Erwin slipped his fingers around his cock and guided it back into Levi’s body.
The soft squelch of Levi’s body parting for him had him shuddering out a moan. His other hand pressed beneath Levi’s body, against his shoulder blades.
Levi’s face was damp when he looked up, his lashes clumped together, with telltale tracks rolling down his cheeks. “Colour?” Erwin asked, stilling his movements, relieved when Levi looked pissed at him for asking.
“Green, asshole,” Levi said, sniffing and then moaning when Erwin rolled his thumb against his growth. He salivated at the shuddering beneath him. “You didn’t do this originally.”
“No? It’s good to change things up.” Erwin pressed their mouths together as he rolled his hips, thrusting shallowly. Levi’s knees lifted either side of his hips before his ankles hooked behind him. The movement felt familiar, and Erwin knew how to fuck good like this. Levi clenched around him purposely, he was certain, but it sent nothing but good feelings through his body, through his cock.
“I love you,” Levi was saying against his mouth, biting at Erwin even when he tried to pull away. Erwin groaned into his mouth, thumb pressed up against Levi, circling him in a way that he could feel his toes curling against his back, his body arching up. As he came, Levi’s body tightened further and further, squeezing Erwin, milking him.
Erwin felt a rush as Levi pulsed around him, unclenching as he came down, loose-limbed and hazy-eyed. Erwin felt too big hunched over him as he was, but still Levi took it, took him, encouraging him with soft, kind words where he was always so harsh.
Erwin felt light-headed as his soft cock slipped from Levi’s body, lube and come and softened muscles easing the way. Levi was trembling beside him, eyes closed like he was sated, one hand cupped over his groin as if to soothe. Erwin reached out and pulled him into his arms, tried to calm the shaking.
“You okay?” Erwin asked when he felt Levi’s body vibrating in his arms. He made a discontented sound somewhere against Erwin’s ribs, where his face was trapped; the annoyance was soothing. “Do you always cry during sex, or was that replication too?”
He deserved the pinch to his ribs, but it was hard enough that his arms slipped from their position and he freed Levi. He laid back in their bed — their bed and sighed.
“Are you sore?” Erwin was sore. His cock ached from how Levi had clenched around it, how hard he had come. His hips and thighs had already been put to work at the gym that morning, that working them now had turned them to soup.
“Good sex always leaves you sore,” Levi said, though his voice was quieter now, and a little far away. Erwin turned to look at him, but he had an odd expression on his face that he couldn’t quite read. “I’m okay.”
“Was it better than the first time?” Erwin asked, trying to force some kind of flashback, like he had with the teapot earlier that day, or even the blood a few days back, but nothing.
Levi looked at him, grey eyes soft enough that Erwin’s heart ached. “Better. I promise.”
++++
For Mike’s birthday, they went out to a bar, and Levi got in on dubious fake ID with a sitter for Isabel for the night. He’d been anxious about leaving her, but calmed after one beer. Levi stuck to Erwin, or Hange, letting them talk to him. All Erwin wanted to do was be with him. It felt so consuming; a lust that they hadn’t been able to temper.
Still, they broke away at some point. Levi left to use the bathroom and to call in on the sitter, so Erwin followed Hange outside for a smoke, belatedly wishing he hadn’t when their enthusiasm for synthetic neurotransmitters became a long bubbling rant. They both jolted when the bar doors opened, the heavy thump of a body hitting the ground.
Levi was on top of a boy from Erwin’s lectures. A whiny asshole, who carried little understanding of the practicalities of litigation and spent most of the time irritating the rest of the class.
“Eat your fucking words,” Levi spat, knuckles pummelling down on the boy’s face, a sickening crunch of bone breaking under the movements. Erwin was shocked for a moment until he realised a crowd had gathered in the open doorway. It was a Wednesday night, and a quieter bar. No security hauling the two apart, even as the boy - Derek - a name old fashioned enough to be named after a father, got his hands around Levi’s small throat and squeezed.
Erwin moved into action, grabbing at Levi beneath his arms and picking him up in a smooth motion, lifting him from the man beneath even when he hissed, squirming and kicking out.
“Smith, you better keep your guard bitch in check,” Derek said, spitting red as he sat up, brown hair sticking up at all ends. His nose looked broken, crooked, and smeared with dark blood. Levi was taut and wired, but stopped wiggling when Erwin turned to him, pulled him from the bar, down the alley, and pushed him up against the wall. He flipped off Hange, catcalling from the sidewalk.
“He was talking shit about you,” Levi said when Erwin pressed a hand to his shoulder, quietly demanding an answer. The doors to the bar had shut now the show was over, but in the background he could hear Hange talking with someone else taking a smoke break. Derek was long gone. Levi was staring up at Erwin, chin steady and eyes fixed. “No one talks shit about you and gets away with it. Not in front of me.”
“Levi,” Erwin said, feeling that tingling warmth spread out from his chest. He lifted his hand, cupped the side of his face. “We should go back inside.”
“What so Mike can rag on me for causing a scene.” Levi scuffed his toes, bumping his old sneakers into Erwin’s smart shoes. “I’m going home. You could come back with me.”
“Invite me nicer than that.”
Levi stared up at him for three long seconds. Erwin counted them with his own breaths before Levi shrugged, eyes bouncing away.
“Come back with me, Blondie.”
“That’s the best I’m getting,” Erwin said with a laugh. No one could see them, this far into the alley, and Hange had moved back into joining the party. Erwin pressed his lips to the centre of Levi’s forehead, breathed in the scent of him. “Come, let’s find a bus.”
They took the bus back to Levi’s apartment, sitting thigh to thigh on the bench, not really speaking. At one point, he caught Levi’s hand in his own, and studied his knuckles, a little scuffed from his fight. He said nothing, just rubbed them softly with the pad of his thumb.
Afterward, Levi lifted onto his toes and kissed Erwin on his doorstop, because he could, because there was no one to see him or judge. He mumbled his thanks to the sitter, but then they were alone, pulling their clothes off to fall into Levi’s bed together.
“Mikes presents were lame,” Levi’s breath was damp against Erwin’s mouth, curled up as they were in his bed, in their underwear and loose t-shirts. Levi hadn’t bought a gift, had come along more as a plus one to Erwin than anything else. Erwin had purchased his friend a second juicer, so he didn’t complain about Erwin borrowing his previous one. “What would be your best gift?”
Erwin rolled onto his back to think, smiling when Levi took that as a chance to lean into his chest. “Anything in the world? I suppose. I would just want to see myself happy. Settled. Perhaps passing the bar and successfully practicing. With you and Izzy.”
“Thought you wanted to teach?” Levi teased and Erwin closed his eyes, slipped a hand against Levi’s ribs beneath his shirt, not straying far, but just feeling him warm and safe.
“What about you?”
“Remember last Christmas?” Levi said quietly. “When it was cold and Isabel was so excited that we all took a walk and saw the batshit lights on that street. We’d go to that. Then afterwards, you’d kiss me in your dad’s kitchen, the smell of sugar and peppermints and cinnamon from all the baking he did. It’s kinda dumb, I guess.”
“It’s a promise,” Erwin said, smiling. Levi’s hands would be cold after a walk like that. Erwin would like to press a kiss to the back of each hand, watch his dark lashes flicker and his small gasp when their lips would bump. He always seemed so surprised whenever Erwin kissed him.
“Good.” Levi leaned forward, pressed their mouths together now, legs wrapped around each other beneath the covers.
Chapter 5
Fracture
Telling his father hadn’t seemed like such a big deal. It was starting small. It was telling the most important person in his life, before they moved on to friends. Before they made it official in any sort of capacity. Before they had sex, even though Levi was getting more brazen, slithering into Erwin’s lap when he’d put Izzy to bed, kissing at his jawline and pressing himself down over Erwin, promising he was ready even if he flinched every time Erwin touched him unexpectedly.
His father had worried last Christmas, because Levi was underage, and maybe the idea of Erwin sleeping with another boy was surprising, but it was different now. Erwin was different, Levi was an adult.
He mentioned it over coffee in his father’s shop. He’d taken the day off to see him. Hadn’t told Levi. With the sun bright in the sky, it highlighted the dust sparkling over the knickknacks. There was a golden mirror sitting on a heavy wooden chest. It looked tarnished and mottled. Levi would have a seizure at the sight.
“Levi and I,” Erwin said, when they moved on from safer topics like his most recent semester and how the family is doing. “Levi and I, our relationship changed recently. We’re wanting to make a go of it as a couple.”
Erwin’s father’s face stilled, his lips drawn thin amongst his beard. “Oh, Erwin. I had hoped our conversation last year would put an end to anything like this.”
“I didn’t think you were narrow enough to be disappointed,” Erwin said, feeling disappointment settle into an ache over his bones, souring his stomach as it clenched. He placed the coffee on the table, fingers pressing to his lips. His thoughts shuffled about him, tried to swallow back resentment as he steadied himself for a poor reaction.
“Erwin, son. It’s not that. But if this thing burns out between the two of you, who will take care of him then?”
“We’re not going to burn out,” Erwin said. “And Levi takes care of himself.”
“You’re both very young.” Erwin watched his father pool his face in his hands, fingers pressed beneath his glasses. “You are made for so much, son. You should go out there and see the world. Finish your studies and take the bar exam. I don’t want you sacrificing things because you’ve met someone, someone who might not even be suited to your world.”
There was a hidden understanding in that, the briefest hint that Erwin’s father didn’t think Levi good enough for him. His hands curled into fists, but he pulled in a deep breath, shrugging off his own disappointment. “If I disagree, what happens then?”
“Erwin.” His father sounded exasperated. When he looked up, his father’s blue eyes were soft behind his glasses. “I’m not sure what kind of father you think me to be that I’d disown you. I like Levi. He sends me photos of Isabel when I ask, lets me call him every so often to check in.”
Erwin frowned. “I didn’t know that.”
“He needs a friend, not a lover. You’re made for different lives, don’t you think?”
“I think I love him,” Erwin said, quiet. He’d always been quick to honesty with his father. He felt an admonished child, hands clasped between his own knees. Like perhaps he was right. Perhaps stability as friendship was better.
“I could be both to him,” Erwin said. “We’re both adults.”
“Erwin, son, I know you’ve been thinking of taking on an internship outside of the state when you’ve passed the bar.”
Erwin shrugged, sheepish. “Well, yes, but only until I’m ready to take on the family business. I need experience outside of this safety net.”
“What are your plans? — have you taken into consideration what it would mean? You would raise a young child. Seeing the two of them a few times a week differs from living with someone. His priorities will be different.”
“Why talk about him like that?”
“I like Levi a lot. He’s a good kid. He’s been wronged in ways I don’t think either of us will ever comprehend, but that doesn’t mean that this is a good thing. If you moved in—”
“I said nothing about moving in together.”
“But I thought you wanted to work for a law firm out of state?”
“Yes bu—”
“Just think about this, Erwin. Think about what you’re actually considering outside of what you currently have. I’m not saying never get with him. I’m just asking you to think whether it really is the best option for the two of you. Would you be happy in the long run?”
Erwin was never one to decide on a whim. He mulled over decisions, analysed until he saw from all angles. He had few important things in his life; he knew that much. Levi and Isabel were at the top. If they were to crumble or break apart, it would be traumatic for the young girl, and Levi was fragile. He didn’t like to think of him like that, but he was.
He made a decision, based upon his father’s input and his own rationalisation. He made excuses for not being able to see Levi the next time he planned, but waited instead to converse with him on a night he knew he’d be home from work.
He knocked on Levi’s door, with a sickness in his stomach. Levi kept it bolted with a chain, and he tried to level his breathing as he heard the metal slide of the chain loosening, as Levi opened it. Levi almost smiled at him as he pulled gently on Erwin’s elbow, pulling him into the apartment. He rolled onto the tops of his toes to kiss Erwin softly before he slipped down and folded his arms over his chest.
“What’s up? You look like shit.”
“Been thinking,” Erwin said. The apartment was quiet. Erwin could see Levi had been sitting at the table folding up laundry. It sat in neat squares, yellows, pinks, oranges. Isabel insisted on wearing the brightest colours. “Is Isabel around?”
“Got her to bed early,” Levi said, and he leaned in, caught Erwins hands in his own and squeezed, pulling him in. His eyes hooded, he had a pink flush over his nose. “Been thinking we could, you know, do stuff. If you want.”
“Do stuff?” Erwin felt lightheaded. Levi’s house smelled like cleaning fluid and his hands were dry and red. Erwin covered them with his own, falling down onto one of the plastic chairs, feeling it groan beneath his weight.
Levi kicked his own chair closer, so their hands didn’t separate. A flush quickly spread from his ears downwards. “Thinking you know, ‘bout using my mouth on you. Sucking you off, if you like. I know I’ve made you wait, but I could do that.”
Erwin felt lightheaded, and he squeezed Levi’s hand. “Oh, Levi.”
“Wow.” Levi laughed flatly, misconstruing. “Fuck, I gave you balls blue enough you can’t even say yes, huh?”
“No, no. Not that, I promise.” He leaned forward, tried to organise his thoughts. Wanted to pull Levi into his mouth and kiss him till he squirmed and laughed, but remembered, instead, the reality. That this wasn’t sustainable if they wanted to maintain a friendship when things fell away. “Relationships based on friendships are strong. We’re good friends, aren’t we, Levi?”
Levi looked confused, plastering his hand to Erwin’s forehead. “Are you sick? Why are you talking weird shit? I don’t want to put up with your whining all night.”
“I like being your friend, Levi.” He did. Because Levi looked out for him, made sure he ate when he stopped functioning, caffeinated him when he knew the study nights weren’t going to be ending, and distracted him with trips out to the zoo with his daughter, or indoor tea-parties when they were too poor for anything else. He was critical, but he didn’t judge like others. “Are we friends, or are we more?”
“More,” Levi said, but he sounded quiet.
“I think we should just be friends. I need to focus on finishing up my studies and you’ve got Isabel. We shouldn’t confuse things.” Erwin kept his voice even, pushed away the prickling of emotion even when he felt Levi’s hand fold tighter over his.
“You focus on your work just fine here,” Levi said. “In fact, being with me is better because I know how to calm you down. No one else knows how.”
“Yes, you do.” Erwin laughed, but noticed how Levi was squeezing onto his fingers tighter and tighter. “But that was something we did before, when we were friends. We could do that again. I think I would prefer that right now.”
“I don’t want to be just friends. And uh I—”
“This doesn’t feel like the right time for a relationship for me. For us.”
“So it’s because we haven’t had sex,” Levi decided, nodding his head. His words sounded thick with a wetness that Erwin refused to think about. “Because if you dumbshit listened to me, you’d have heard me say I was ready now.”
“Levi.”
“I’m ready. C’mon, Erwin. What’s gotten into you? You don’t have to be chivalrous or any shit. You know I hate that.”
“I want us to just be friends.” He didn’t, even less so when he saw the realisation dawn on Levi’s feature, his brow furrowing, lips pinching together, when he realised Erwin couldn’t be convinced. “I think if we end it here, then we won’t have ruined what we have already.”
“Is there someone else?” Levi asked instead, finally tugging his hands free. They shook, Erwin noticed, before Levi shoved them under his armpits. “You wanna be with someone else?”
“No one.”
“Then I don’t fucking get it.”
Erwin sat still, eyes down on his own knees as he listened to Levi breathe beside him. Quietly, very quietly.
“Did I do something wrong?” Levi asked. “‘Cause I can fix it. Probably.”
“You did nothing wrong. I promise. It’s nothing to do with you. It’s me,” Erwin said, looking up when Levi stood up. He paced for a few seconds, arms still held tight under his arms before he disappeared behind the screen shielding his bed from the living space. Erwin could see the shadow of him through the material, how he was standing with his back against it, before he sat down in a crouch. His shadow was hazy, but still Erwin could see the way his shoulders were rattling.
“Levi,” Erwin said, thinking to approach but hesitating. He stood on the other side of the screen and waited. Hated himself the whole time, yet still waited.
“Why are you still here?” Levi whispered. Erwin nodded his head silently, and then left.
No one mentioned it, though he supposed they probably talked about him behind his back. Hange was the only one to really bring Levi up. They wanted to invite him to their birthday party, on the understanding that he didn’t throw hands as he had at Mike’s. Hange liked Levi, found him funny.
No one knew their relationship had changed. No one except maybe Moblit, but he said nothing, polite as always.
“I think he’s probably busy,” Erwin said, warning their comments away.
Erwin threw himself into his studies. He wasn’t going to go into academics; he decided. No point mooning over that. He would do what the plan had always been; pass the bar, rise through the ranks in a law firm somewhere else for a while, properly cut his teeth and then return, take up a position in the family firm. Do what he was supposed to.
Then he forgot to attend Hange’s party. He’d spent the night holed up in the library, books sprawled in front of him, staring at the highlighted lawsuits on the screen ahead of him. They accepted his apology, and he shied away from the concern on their face. Mike invited him to work out, but he faked out an excuse. Erwin didn’t go to the diner anymore, and he drank coffee of better quality elsewhere. He didn’t get to join in with Isabel’s ludicrous plans to wind up her dad. Didn’t get the same five Disney songs stuck in his head.
It was night that was the hardest, because he remembered what it was like falling asleep in Levi’s narrow bed, curled to the wall to give him space. Knew how good it felt to care for someone that spent their entire life looking after everyone else. And all he could think about what how Levi had looked at him when he had screwed everything up.
He found it hard engaging with his roommates; fought with Mike, who was thrilled that Erwin was no longer spending time with “technically high-schooler with a bad attitude” and joining the adult world again, but also not really, because he refused to go anywhere or do anything. Erwin was a spoilsport. Didn’t stay out the apartment, even when Mike was entertaining and would prefer privacy. Otherwise kept his head down. He went to the library, he went to his lectures, he didn’t call out his professor on any of the blatant mistakes and he tried to ignore how every time he attended his classes, he remembers his first meeting with Levi. With Isabel. He went through the motions; Erwin lived through the motions.
There was a familiar pair of beat up sneakers in front of him. Erwin was sitting with his head stooped down, hunched on the bench outside his apartment. Not waiting for the bus, or anything really. Just sitting because he could.
“Oi, you look like shit.”
Levi.
“Levi?” he lifted his head to see Levi staring down at him. It was spring now, and he was in a thin hoodie, his hands in his pocket. He was frowning down at Erwin, grey eyes blank. “What are you doing here?”
“Hange called. Said you needed cheering up.” Levi took a seat on the bench beside Erwin, with enough space between them to make it intentional. Levi was staring down at his feet, hands still wedged into his pockets. Erwin couldn’t stop looking at him, the beautiful sight of him. He felt his heart beat in his chest, felt alive for three long seconds before he swallowed.
“How’s Isabel?”
“Batshit as ever,” Levi shrugged. “Misses you.”
Erwin missed her too, missed the both of them, but knew it wasn’t his place to say so.
“You said you wanted to be friends,” Levi said quietly. “Let’s be friends. You look like you fucking need it.”

Erwin was nervous about heading to his father’s shop. The one he ran now, instead of practicing law like he’d studied for. Or teaching, as he had desired. He tried to imagine the store as it was, but the thought of it not being exactly as he remembered made anxiety churn deep in his gut. If Levi had left any sort of mark on the place, it would certainly be tidier.
Erwin had a vague recollection of a serious blonde boy sitting with Mr Artlet back when Erwin visited his father once, but that was a long time ago, and the boy would now be a young man in his early twenties by Levi’s calculations. Erwin was almost nervous about meeting him, wondering how much of their relationship he had lost. It was exhausting relearning the lines drawn in friendships.
“I think I’m going to pick up a rental,” Erwin said, folding himself into the passenger side of the car. Levi had packed him a lunch and a thermos of hot coffee. “While we wait for the insurance to come through.”
“I don’t mind driving,” Levi said, frowning.
“I don’t want to beg for rides either.” Erwin was kind in his statement. Levi had been lovely to him that morning, woken him up with kisses over his eyes, thumb stroking gently over his cheek. He’d beckoned Erwin into the shower and had clothes waiting for him.
“Armin’s a good kid, but he’s a nosy little shit. You just have to give him boundaries and he’s fine,” Levi said, pulling up outside the store. They were a little later than opening, and Erwin could see the dull lighting inside, could see a bobbing head behind the desk. His stomach squirmed.
“I keep thinking that I’m going to walk in there and see my father sitting behind the desk.”
“Ghosts aren’t real,” Levi said, but it sounded like he was trying to joke. Erwin simply hummed in response.
“What do I do there all day?”
“Well, you’re still — it’s a little like your dad’s house. You don’t wanna let go yet.”
“And you’re not pestering me to?” Erwin asked, relieved actually, that Levi was the one he was seeing his grieving process through. Marie would have him in therapy, would have him keeping himself busy to stop any lingering thoughts. Levi always just allowed Erwin to breathe, to exist beside him. He had a tendency to clam up.
“Go inside. Do Erwin things,” Levi said. He leaned over and kissed Erwin’s jaw. He was more tactile now, after last night, seeking comfort from Erwin in ways he hadn’t previously. “I’ll see you this afternoon.”
Armin was both exactly what Erwin had imagined and something else entirely. He was blond and pretty looking, friendly if a little awkward. He was sitting behind the counter when Erwin arrived, tinkering around with something small in his hand.
“Erwin!” He bounced from his chair with excitement, or eagerness perhaps, blue eyes widening at the sight of him. “Levi blocked my number. I was so worried. Are you okay?”
“Levi blocked you?” Erwin asked, laughing when the boy’s face slipped into a sheepish expression.
“I got upset when I saw you in the hospital. Seeing you in a coma reminded me of my grandad, I guess,” Armin shrugged a shoulder, his hands hidden in his jean pockets. “He sent me home, told me you were awake and then blocked me.”
“He shouldn’t have done that,” Erwin said, exasperated suddenly. “I’m sorry. I don’t know how much you’re aware of—”
“I know you don’t remember the last couple of years. Levi told me when he said you were coming back to work. I’m sorry. You probably don’t remember me.” Armin’s lips stretched into a grimace, and he looked for a moment, terribly panicked.
“No, I don’t,” Erwin answered truthfully. “But we have time to get to know each other. I knew your grandfather a little.”
“Yeah.” Armin’s shoulders slumped, as if the grief was still fresh. Though he stopped looking so fearfully at Erwin. “Do you remember Levi at all? It must be hard.”
“I remember nothing from the last four years - sometimes flashes.” Erwin leaned against the counter, pleased actually, to be talking to someone who asked so frankly, someone who wasn’t caught up with years of complicated relationships. “I recall giving Levi a teapot but not marrying him. At least I know him. Loved him, even if I don’t recall our relationship changing, but there was always love there.”
“That’s sweet,” Armin said, smiling softly. There was something wistful in his bright blue eyes. “I haven’t been in the backroom. I can stay out front while you go through it. I-If you need a hand, I’m here.”
“Thank you, Armin,” Erwin said softly.
There was a sense of nostalgia being back in the shop. It had shaped his childhood; his teen years he had avoided it where he could — took a job shadowing at the law firm when his grandfather was still alive, so he didn’t have to spend dull Saturdays running it, but as a child he would come here after school, do his homework at his father’s desk while he sat out front, charmed older ladies who came in looking for gifts, who soaked his father up in their tales, the objects they were looking to have valued.
It had been cosy and safe; his father told stories made up of the trinkets he purchased; the old book from the 1800s with the ornate gold pages, the hairpin his father had agonised over dating, the telescope slim and gold - surely belonged to an explorer. Erwin would help come up with stories in his father’s lap, the two of them existing in the world together.
Now he sat in his father’s old chair, wood and leather, and felt a little large for it. The back office definitely seemed tidier than he recalled, tidier than he knew he was prone to being, which he could only presume was Levi. There were two photo frames on the vacant desk, a crystal glass with two black fountain pens, one he remembered his father using; a magnifying glass and a stack of paperwork neatly held together by a paperclip. All so immaculate.
He picked up the photos. The first was his father, cheerful and bearded, sitting in his favourite chair in his house beneath the window. He looked healthy in it, healthier than he remembered, fuller in the face, in a bright blue jumper and trousers always hemmed a little too short, so the green and purple socks showed beneath. The socks, he recalled, had been a gift from Isabel during one of their Christmases spent together.
The second photo was of the three of them. A blue and white castle behind them, spectacular if a little twee. They all had on Disney ears; Ariel for Isabel. Maleficent for Levi and Pluto for Erwin. He laughed for a moment, staring at Isabel with her arms punching the air — she only looked a little younger, perhaps fifteen or sixteen. Levi with his arms crossed beside her and Erwin behind, smiling wide for the camera. They looked happy, in their odd little way. He must have gotten a physical copy of the photo, put it in a frame, so he was reminded of his family every time he stepped into the office.
He pulled his phone out, snapped a photo and sent it along with a message to Isabel.
Disneyland?
DisneyWorld dad 2. Don’t be lame. Take me back
Armin poked his head around the door when Erwin had sat staring into space for far longer than he’d like to admit. Grief sat a little heavier in his chest than it had before, and he found he wanted to be away from this place, back in Levi’s small teashop, with his husband fussing from a quiet place beyond him.
“Levi’s been here,” Erwin said, when the boy hovered, something clutched in his hand. Armin nodded his blond head.
“He was here whenever they kicked him from the hospital,” Armin said. “You never let him in here normally. Not when he was feeling fierce. That’s what you called it. You said it was the one place he wasn’t allowed. Usually he respected that, but I think he wanted to be busy.”
“He finds cleaning soothing,” Erwin said, remembering Levi in one of those moods in the past. Wouldn’t talk, but he’d scrub the grout sparkling between the bathroom tiles. “It’s very tidy.”
“Yeah.” Armin shrugged, blue eyes rolling around the room but not meeting Erwin’s. “I was freaking out. He left me food and tea, even if he blocked me. We couldn’t find the key for your desk, but Levi said that was your own fault if there was something in there that we needed.”
“That sounds like Levi.” Erwin looked down at the desk, rattled his fingertips against the edging. “I’m afraid I remember very little, Armin. H-how… what do I do with my time here?”
A flicker of something crossed the boy’s forehead. Erwin noticed. He had a poor poker face. “Well, you come here to feel closer to your dad, I suppose. You’ve been here a lot lately. Especially when you got hired.”
“Hired?” Armin’s eyes widened, and his shoulders lifted high, fingers closing around the chain in his hand.
“Oh,” he said, biting down onto his lip, aware perhaps that he had said something he ought not to have done. “They offered you an academic position at the university. You prepped for it here. Said it was easier than at home because it made you nervous.”
“I never fucking lied to you,” Levi said in the car the moment Erwin announced his surprise at his job offer. He’d admittedly spent the rest of the morning spiralling from the discovery, enough that Armin had cautiously kept his distance and apologetically said goodbye to him when Erwin left.
“You withheld the truth.”
“They postponed it for the semester to let you recover. With your dad, and having to grieve, I just wanted to give you a chance to not think about work.”
Levi sounded sheepish, which was so unlike him, and his head tilted down, hair shielding his eyes as a defence.
“Did you not want me to take it?” Erwin asked, and watched the fury light up Levi’s small body. He bristled like a furious cat, chin lifting until his silver eyes caught Erwin’s.
“When have I ever stood in your way?” He asked, voice clipped with aggression. He wiped his mouth and took a deep breath. “You worked hard to earn it, but you were freaking out about it before the accident. Worried about what your dad would think, as if he was fucking alive. You started spending more time in that shitty back room, like he was fucking talking to you.”
The fight went out of Erwin as Levi fiddled with his seatbelt. He was angry at having to learn the truth from the boy that worked in his shop rather than his husband. He had thought little about work at all since waking up.
“I’m a professor,” Erwin said. “What I always wanted.”
“You write prolifically in journals. You spent a lot of the last year publishing and making a name for yourself,” Levi answered quietly. “You hated the practice in California. Hated the lifestyle. I remember all those years back you telling me your dream was to teach. Every time you talked about passing the bar and practicing, I could see how much you hated the idea.”
“It was,” Erwin admitted, although he had barely admitted it to himself. He thought it would disappoint his father if he strayed too far from the truth. “What about the family practice?”
“Sold your shares in it. Told your uncle you had no interest in practicing or becoming a partner. You don’t talk. He’s a cunt.”
“I — yes.” Erwin rubbed his head and flinched when he rubbed against the still-sore bruising. He looked at Levi, still wrought and curled up in the seat like a frigid cat. He moved his hand, curling it over Levi’s shoulder. “Why hide all this from me?”
“I wasn’t hiding it.” Levi’s eyes skirted Erwin’s, although he dropped his head down for a moment to touch his cheek to Erwin’s hand resting on his shoulder. “Didn’t want to overwhelm you. You’re divorced, married to me, and your father is dead. Those seemed like bigger issues.”
He was probably right, but Erwin still felt sick about the entire thing. “The last lie?”
“It wasn’t a lie,” Levi croaked. “I didn’t want to overwhelm you.”
Erwin understood that. He nodded. Levi had never been good with his words, and no one else had mentioned it to him either. Mike had made enough of a point to suggest he wasn’t thrilled about Erwin’s relationship with Levi, but nothing specific. He wasn’t entirely sure how much Isabel knew.
“You also blocked Armin from my phone. That’s not the decent thing to do,” Erwin said, when Levi pulled away from the side of the road. Levi didn’t bristle at this, simply shrugging his shoulder.
“Yeah, well, the brat needs to learn boundaries. He was getting antsy about you being gone.” Erwin thought to Armin, the few conversations they had had scattered throughout the day; losing his grandfather had seemed integral to his growth over the past few years. “He was getting neurotic when he visited.”
“He mentioned his grandfather to me,” Erwin said, musing back to the first conversation he’d had. "Seeing me in the hospital reminded him of losing him."
“Probably,” Levi shrugged. “But he also thinks you shit goddamn unicorns. I live with you. You don’t.”
“I saw the photo on the desk,” Erwin said after a while of driving. The atmosphere couldn’t be described as particularly positive and he wanted to change that. Didn’t want to fight with Levi. “There’s a photo of the three of us on the desk. Disney World.”
“I put it there,” Levi said quietly. “It’s your favourite, and you had nothing of yourself there, so I—” his lips pursed together as he drove. Levi wasn’t always good with words, better with actions. Erwin understood what he was trying to say, he thought. What he was implying, but waited for him to continue all the same. “You kept that place like a shrine, but it was yours too. He wouldn’t want it like that. I put your certificates on the wall and photos on the desk. Cleared away the filth.”
“I suppose you’re right,” Erwin sighed, closing his eyes as they moved through the traffic. He itched to swap places with Levi, to wrap his hands around the steering wheel, his foot against the pedal. He preferred to drive stick, but automatic was fine. It was better than stagnating like this. “When did we go?”
“About six months after we got together,” Levi said quietly. “I’d been saving for years to take Izzy. Neither of us had flown before. She had the best time. Made us wear those dumb mouse ears, made you go on all the thrill rides with her because I wasn’t gonna.”
“I wish I remember.”
“I wish you did too.” Levi pulled to a stop as they got caught in the late-afternoon rush. “It was the first good time we had, I think. You seemed happy. After your dad dying. Your divorce. You know, all that shit.” Erwin looked at Levi, at his profile, couldn’t help but sense that he was withholding information. For his sake, he knew. Levi wasn’t callous, and never cruel with intent, but that didn’t mean he would always come clean about everything. “It wasn’t easy on you. On us. But we went away like a family. Felt good.”
When they got home, Levi insisted they go on a run together. Erwin did as he was told, knew he would feel better for it, and enjoyed the sight of Levi’s ass in the tight black leggings. It was late afternoon, and there was a chill kicking about as the sun dipped low.
“Is this something we do?” Erwin asked, when they stopped to stretch and he caught his breath. Levi had one foot up on a park bench and was bending down. Erwin’s eyes skirted the back of his thighs, appreciating the view as he kicked one leg up behind him. He felt sluggish compared to Levi’s nimble movements.
“No,” Levi admitted, “but I figured amnesia’s a good as time as any to get you into a cardio routine.”
“That’s a low blow.” Erwin laughed, his eyes lingered lower again. “You look good in leggings.”
“You fucking leach” Levi kicked his foot up, so Erwin had to catch it. He held it as Levi used him as resistance, stretching out his hamstring “Hange messaged earlier. They’re free tomorrow if you want to head over.”
“Will you be coming?” Levi got on with Hange, or at least, Hange never took offence to his mannerisms or idiosyncrasies. They hadn’t judged Levi for his lack of education, or having Isabel so young. Back then, their inquisitive nature had been an irritant and Levi had snapped during friendly gatherings, but it had been easy; no concern or genuine lack of trust as there had with Mike.
“I don’t want to get in your way,” Levi said. “You should take the car. I have shit I need to do — I’ve neglected stuff since the accident.”
Erwin felt disappointed and Levi must have read it on his face because there was a softness that happened in the minuscule shift of his eyebrows. He dropped his foot and kicked his other one up, leaning into the resistance again.
“They can talk boring shit with you that sends me catty. Work stuff. Sex stuff.” One time Erwin had walked into the apartment they shared to see Levi had Hange pinned up against the wall, fingers curled into the soft sweater.
“I wasn’t insulting you! I was curious,” Hange pleaded, although they didn’t sound convincing. Erwin had brought Levi down enough for him to step away, but he’d been quivering when Erwin had touched his shoulder, spitting nasty barbs in Hange’s direction even as his voice calmed. Erwin hadn’t asked what it was Hange had enquired about.
But Levi had tolerated Hange after every argument, and liked when Hange explained equations to Isabel that went over all their heads, and took her to the science museum, when Levi needed to go shopping. And he’d liked Moblit even more. Perhaps because he said little. The two of them would sit together, Levi prissy and sour, Moblit with his head tilted down, absorbed in his charcoal.
“I suppose I ought to meet Pieck as well.”
“You’ve already met,” Levi said gently, dropping his foot down, and staring at his sports watch strapped to his wrist “She’s nice. You like her. Come on, we have to beat our time home.”
Erwin didn’t beat his time back, but he enjoyed watching Levi from behind, skipping lightly, softly. Levi was much the same as he had always been, poorer with his words than most, but made up for it with actions. He wanted Erwin to have time alone with his friends where he wouldn’t ruin the mood or cause a distraction.
Erwin was sent to the shower once he made it back to the house, wrung with sweat and flushed cheeks. Levi touched small fingers to his racing heart and tutted, pushed at Erwin until he made his way to the bathroom.
His head no longer ached in the way it had as he left the hospital, and while the endorphins form the run his it somewhat, he felt an unease at how he was physically mending, without regaining all that he had lost. He mourned, mourned for the man who had found a home with the family he had desired, who had vacationed in the one place Levi had tirelessly worked to afford.
Erwin thought he probably wept, masked by the shower. He felt hollowed and shamed. Wished he could be better.
Hange’s house was a sign of their wealth, afforded mostly because Moblit was a decent enough local artist, and also ran a gallery downtown that brought in most of their earnings. Erwin had always planned on commissioning his old friend for a drawing of Marie, but had backed out. She was all soft lines, and he worried the smears of grey charcoal would harden her. He hadn’t wanted to do that.
The house was a one level sprawling build of squat glass and concrete, out of place in the rest of the neighbourhood, but set upon a slight hill. Erwin pulled into the driveway as his gps announced his arrival. He sat in the car, fingers tight on the worn wheel, as he tried to calm his nerves. He was visiting old friends, friends that knew him. He just wished Levi had joined in.
Erwin barely made it out of the car when the front door was thrown open and Hange was ambling toward him. They looked almost exactly as they always had, messy brown hair pulled half-up, glasses smudged and dirty, a bright smirk on their face. They looked a little older, smile lines settled sharper on either side of their mouth. Their clothes were just as soiled, but the sweater looked to be a wool blend rather than acrylic. By the grub clinging to the knees of their pants, and beneath their nails, they’d spent most of the day gardening, and hadn’t bothered freshening up.
“Erwin Smith, as I live and breathe. Remember me?” Hange said, throwing an arm over his shoulder. He relaxed at the sight and touch, bringing a genuine smile. They had an affable smile, and foul enough breath, Erwin could hear Levi’s rude uttering in his ear about it.
“Not forgettable in any sense of the word,” Erwin said, pulling them in briefly. It was dusk now, and the warm glow from the house was an enticing pull.
Moblit was deep in his studio working on a commission for a local socialite, according to Hange, so they were left alone. They pulled Erwin into the kitchen with a cup of hot coffee, which was surprisingly tasty and the right side of bitter.
“Levi mentioned someone name Pieck,” Erwin said, somehow comforted enough by Hange to reveal his embarrassment at the blanks he was drawing. “I’m still catching up on the last few years.”
“Pieck? Yes, she’s quite something. She’s a nurse. Here, have a look. See what you think.” Hange handed their phone over; a cracked screen despite the shock-proof purple case, adding to the chunkiness.
Between the cracks, Erwin peered down at a young woman, perhaps in her late twenties. She had soft, wide eyes and long dark hair holding a natural curl. A certain type of pretty, with a gentle smile and dark circles beneath her eyes.
“Very nice,” Erwin said, handing the phone back. “Fill me in on how it works with the three of you?”
Hange did with gusto. Monogamy had never been something that they and Moblit had practiced, but no one had ever become quite so entangled in their lives as Pieck.
“Moblit isn’t interested?”
“No. It’s always just been me for him, but they get on well. Pieck spends most weekends here. She likes Levi. Well, I met her through him. Imagine that, huh.” Hange’s eyes twinkled beneath their smudged lenses, leaning onto the counter toward him. Erwin nodded, though he wasn’t sure what was meant by that.
“How is Levi?” Erwin asked instead. He hadn’t asked Mike, because they had never had a strong enough relationship, and it hadn’t seemed fair to ask his step-daughter either.
“Honestly? Not too good after your accident. Isabel called Pieck because she knows how to handle him. Between the two of them they got him to leave your side for a bit. When they said you’d come around, he was a little easier.”
It was strange thinking about that time. He’d woken with a dreadfully sore throat from the tube, and cracked lips, but knew little else beyond that. Levi had been nothing but strong since he’d come home. Awkward maybe, but then Levi was always awkward.
“He never gave up on you,” Hange said softly, between sips of their own coffee. “He’s good for you and you’re good for him. It just took you a long time to work things out.”
“I repressed my feelings for a long time,” Erwin admitted, scratching at his jaw with one hand, shaking the edges of his coffee with the other. “I have this life that I don’t understand. I miss my wife even if I ought not to. Even if I love Levi, if I feel relief at the thought of living a life with him. I miss my old life.”
“I don’t think that’s unusual. He’s what you love, but he isn’t what you know.”
Erwin nodded his head. “Was it amicable with Marie?”
“I wouldn’t be able to answer that,” Hange said straight. They always said things straight, mostly unbiased, which is why he favoured their words over Mike or Levi. “You seen Mike yet?”
Erwin nodded, and explained he had seen him earlier in the week, how he’d apparently they were gym buddies and watched sports together.
“Yeah, that’s your special time together.” Hange curved their fingers around the mug. Their nails were jagged and clumped with dirt. “We should all hang out at some point.”
“There’s still tension between Levi and Mike.”
“They’re grown men. They can put on their big boy pants and get over it.” Hange batted a hand. “Moblit would like to see you, and Pieck.”
“Do I like her?”
“You pretend to like everyone. That’s a flaw before you take it the other way,” Hange’s smirk twisted, layers of history stitched between the words. Erwin remembered a great deal of it too, his charm drawing lines in the sand wherever rifts grew. “You like that she gets on with Levi. I won’t lie to you, Erwin. As a group, Moblit and me, Mike and Nana — we’ve always been your friend first, but I met Pieck through Levi. It’s good they have each other among all our bullshit. We’re not easy for her — or I’m too much, and you’re no saint.”
Hange didn’t expand on that, didn’t need to. “I had always hoped—” the words were dangerous, useless and not fit for a conversation with a friend rather than a husband. Hange clapped him too hard on the shoulder, their fingernails biting down.
“You got what you always wanted. Maybe you shouldn’t think so hard about what you can’t remember, huh?”
They moved from coffee to wine, which was an odd choice, but then Moblit joined them and he looked older than Erwin recalled, deep lines settling by his eyes, but perhaps that was because of the smile etched on his face. Erwin didn’t ask. It wasn’t his place, but he was fascinated by the understanding he had. Surely this one was different, having Hange take on a lover significant enough that they shared living space together now.
They spoke about work, although Erwin was too ashamed to bring up his newfound understanding of his role at the university and Hange either had a brand new level of tact, or Levi had threatened blood if they brought it up because they kept quiet, keeping to safer topics like friendship, and wine, and the TV shows he’d forgotten about.
“You gained a weird love of art-house horror a few years back. Levi hates them, it’s quite funny,” Moblit informed him seriously as they rested after a round of burned grilled cheese, when Hange decided that’s all they had in to eat. “Then you got Isabel into them for the artistic references and he still seethes about it.”
“He kicked you out of the house when he caught nightmares from the time you forced him to watch one. You planned to sleep in the car. He only let you back in because he was too freaked to sleep alone,” Hange cackled, cheeks flushed with the humour of the memory. Erwin smiled along, wishing for a flashback of some sort, but nothing. Not one thing struck him as familiar.
He used that conversation to discuss his current lack of car situation. Levi hadn’t been sold on the idea of him hiring a car, but he was itching to have something that wasn’t borrowed. Everything felt borrowed from another Erwin right now. He wanted some control back.
“I think I can help with that!” Hange said, eyes on Moblit, who nodded before the three of them walked to the garage.
Hange drove a godawful minivan now, parked askew in the garage, but there was a decent Hyundai with fair mileage just taking up space. The three of them moved, sluggish on wine to look at it. Erwin hesitated, but agreed with only a little hesitance.
“Pieck only drives a little Fiat, but getting rid of this car will give us more space,” Hange said, standing with their hands on their hips. “It’s yours if you want it.”
“Will Levi be furious? How does he feel about you driving?” Moblit asked casually, as Erwin pocketed the keys. He’d have to come back for it, as he had borrowed Levi’s car for the night.
“Possibly. Perhaps I’ll blame it on the head injury. I’ve barely used the excuse yet.”
“Hmm, that would work,” Hange said, at long last peeling their glasses from their nose to wipe at the smudge marks. When Erwin opened his mouth to discuss a cost, Hange batted their hands. “Don’t want to hear it. Smith, it’s yours. Take it.”
Erwin drove back some time later and found Levi curled up on the couch, one arm tucked under his head, the other resting on his chest. He was wearing a black hoodie so large that it must belong to Erwin. Erwin lifted Levi’s legs to take their place, letting them settle over his lap. He rubbed at Levi’s knees over the cotton, studying his face.
Levi looked tired, though Levi had looked tired ever since he’d met him with a precocious toddler in tow. His eyes looked bloodshot around the silver, his hair flat as if he had been pulling at it. Erwin wanted to ask how he was doing, but Levi’s hand slipped over the tops of his knuckles where they were resting on his knee and he closed his mouth.
“Did you have a nice time?” Levi asked instead, voice a little hoarse.
“We drank coffee, then wine, then Hange served grilled cheese. They burned it, of course. It was good to see them and Moblit,” Erwin said, closing his eyes. It had been great to see them both; two familiar faces, two open, kind faces, unchanged even if age had pecked away at their youthfulness. “How did you meet Pieck?”
“Mmm?” Levi slid his hazy eyes over to Erwin when their eyes met, blinking slowly until Erwin repeated himself. He squeezed Levi’s legs gently, feeling slender muscle and bone under his touch.
“She’s a nurse. I met her at the hospital,” Levi said quietly. “Last year when—” he waved his hands in front of him, over his own lower abdomen and Erwin nodded, wished to share in Levi’s grief, if he knew it to be grief. Did they grieve or was it just relief, as Levi had said? “I hate doctors, don’t trust nurses, but she wasn’t like the rest of ‘em. Then she went and hooked up with shitty four eyes to make things awkward.” Erwin laughed along with Levi, pleased with the break in atmosphere.
“Hange seemed happy.”
“Wouldn’t you be with two people on their fucking knees for you?”
“Perhaps,” Erwin said, skirting familiar thoughts he’d had years before, when there’d been choices to make.
Levi was still quiet when they readied themselves for bed. He was minty fresh and scrubbed pink, stripped from the black hoodie into a t-shirt and briefs. He curled up against Erwin, feline-like in his sprawl, fingers pressed down over the dark blonde hair growing over Erwin’s chest.
“I have therapy on Tuesday evenings,” Levi said quietly. “Always makes me like this.”
“You’re willingly in therapy?” Erwin asked, listening to Levi snort, cheek laid down over his breast. He’d been forced into group therapy at certain points, but he’d never much liked it, and had been vocal in his distaste for it.
“He’s called Onyankopon. I don’t wanna kill him… most of the time,” Levi sighed. “It’s good for me. Gets the shit ordered and out of my head. Makes me better to live with.”
“That’s why you didn’t come tonight?”
“Why — you need me to hold your hand while you speak to your friends?”
“Not at all.” Erwin felt a tingle of shame, soothed only by Levi’s small hand rubbing over his ribs; as much as an apology as he was going to get. “What would I normally do?”
“Keep your damn mouth shut and hold me.”
The next few days went past in a gentle wave of familiarity. He felt almost as if he was falling into a routine. Erwin had no flashbacks, but tried not to push Levi away. They argued a little, when Erwin finally admitted he had a car via Hange, but Levi didn’t drag the argument beyond the morning and was vaguely receptive to affection when Erwin showed up after work with a bunch of flowers.
It was all still so strange. Going through the motions was about all he could do. He felt a deep love for Levi, who he had loved for a long time, even if he buried it deep, but still he craved those mornings with Marie, feeling her body through those silk pyjamas, the smell of her expensive hair products, brushing her hair as she sat on the chair in front of the dresser. He missed dry work meetings, looking out of their office sky-rise and seeing the Golden Gate Bridge far off, missed work drinks in the middle of the afternoon, if only for how it sealed settlements and disputes. He missed his house, up on the hill, missed the ease with which he travelled through life, growing up with the woman he had decided to love when his father had voiced concern over his relationship with Levi all those years back.
“The first bouquet of roses you bought him. He dried the petals after and added them to a black tea. It’s your favourite,” Isabel said, throwing down a cup of black tea in front of him. From the scent alone, it was the one Levi had offered him that he had considered too perfumed. “Fucking disgusting.”
“Thank you, Isabel,” he said, aware of the two older ladies sitting at the table behind him. She puffed out a breath, blowing her red bangs from her forehead before falling into the chair opposite. Levi was ringing up customers behind the counter, his gruff manner seeing to them quickly.
“Is it weird not remembering anything about this?”
Yes, he wanted to say, but he didn’t. “It would be weirder if I had no memory of anyone in my life, but I know you all.”
“And you loooove us?” Her lips twisted up into a filthy grin, infectious as she always had been, as she cackled loudly. Erwin laughed along with her, hushing her only when Levi’s eyes flashed from behind the counter and the women coughed in discontent.
She technically should have been helping her father run the shop, but it was a quiet late afternoon and instead she spent her time showing Erwin the photos from their Florida vacation a few years back.
“Took dad like a decade to save up, but I’m gonna take him back one day,” she whispered, so they weren’t overheard. “Might have to sedate him to get him on a plane again, but it was worth it. He liked how clean it was.”
“I wish I could remember,” he said quietly, fond as he stared down at another photo of Isabel in a summer dress posing with Minnie Mouse.
“That’s another reason to go back. So my dad number two gets some good memories back.”
Isabel had practice at the rink that night and left in Levi’s car with a promise not to do anything too stupid. Erwin watched Levi hug her, before she clattered from the teashop, her battered skates dangling from her hands. Erwin helped Levi close up and held him close in the backroom when Levi had locked the safe.
“I’ve just found out about the tea. I’m sorry I was insensitive,” he said, cupping the back of Levi’s head. If he closed his eyes, it was like a decade and a bit before, holding Levi as he had.
“Turns out old you was a fucking liar,” Levi said, rough but not bitter. He leaned his forehead against Erwin’s chest, arms up around his waist. “It’s okay. Let’s go home.”
“How did we get together?” He asked later, wondering if there was a way for him to contact Marie, just to see her, without hurting Levi. Levi would be hurt by it — how would he not be? Erwin had picked Marie over him once. This would feel the same. He didn’t wish to be cruel, not when Levi had been nothing but supportive, when his attempts at protecting Erwin had been clumsy but well-intentioned.
They were in the living room after dinner, Erwin with one of his father’s old western novels. Levi was sitting on the floor under the floor lamp, darning a hole in one of Isabel’s shirts.
“I told you it was after your father died,” Levi said quietly. Erwin looked down to watch him bite at the thread to break it, twisting the excess around his finger. With his head directly under the yellow glow of the lamp, the black reflected almost blue.
“I meant specifics. If you told me, it might trigger a memory,” Erwin said, clearing his throat once the words were free. He felt exposed and raw, which was fine, only they skirted around it most of the time; this gap in time he had.
The only noise was the sound of the needle piercing the cotton, the soft slide of thread as Levi pulled, hiding the hole. Erwin looked down at Levi’s handiwork, waiting for an answer.
“We never hated each other, even when I pissed you off. Even when you broke my heart, there was never hate.” Levi placed the darned shirt in his lap, but stared down instead at the silver needle, the light reflecting off it. “Your relationship with Marie had faltered, and I cared for you. I was there for you. We could fix things like fucking adults with no pressure. It just made sense. You told me you loved me and I’d waited ten fucking years to hear you say it.”
“Why did you wait?”
“Because I knew your truth, even if you refused to believe it. Not like I didn’t try finding someone else, but I’m not built for relationships with anyone but you.” Erwin thought to Zeke, the blonde with the glasses and the beard, how Levi smelled like his aftershave and wore his jacket and the burn of jealousy that turned his own sweat sour, had him breathing deeper through his lungs because Levi had given himself up to a man like that.
“I never quite understood how you loved so intently, even when I tried pushing you away.”
“Yeah, well, I didn’t want to, but that’s the thing with love, right? You don’t get a fucking say in it.”
“Yes, you’re right.”
“Mmm.” Levi placed the needle back in his sewing kit before placing it on the coffee table, along with Isabel’s now folded and fixed shirt. He crawled towards Erwin, right there on the floor until he was in front of him, until he sat eye level with Erwin’s knees. It was unsettling how the heat pooled so quickly at the sight.
“Levi,” Erwin said, leaning forward to stroke his hair from his face. The longer parts caught in his eyelashes until Erwin pushed it away. “What are you doing down there?”
“You like me down here,” Levi said, sitting up on his knees, his hands determined in how they palmed Erwin through his jeans. He wriggled as close as the couch allowed and bowed his head down to kiss at Erwin’s stomach, pushing up his shirt so his little mouth could suck at bare skin.
“I was asking how we got together,” Erwin said, trying to focus. “When did we marry?”
“I did this to you not long after we got together,” Levi bit back, nimble fingers sliding down Erwin’s zipper, quick thumb popping open the button. His hands were always cold, and it made Erwin hiss when he peeled his cock from his underwear.
Levi’s mouth looked too small to take the weight of his cock, and he teased with kitten licks at first, the swipe of his pink tongue, his mouth pressing perfect kisses against the underside of his cock, teasing him to full hardness until he could suck him into his mouth, lips smeared with pearly precome.
He’d thought about this years before. Thought about Levi’s hot wet mouth feasting on him. When they hadn’t been able to do much more than kiss and cuddle, he would take care of himself in the shower and imagine Levi on his knees, playing with Erwin’s cock, asking Erwin for more.
Erwin fixed his hands in Levi’s hair as he bobbed his head, his length gliding into that damp mouth. He didn’t move Levi, or direct, as much as he wanted. Levi fitted in what he could, until he felt the soft clench of Levi’s throat as he swallowed, holding onto the rest of him in a tight grip. Every so often Levi would pull his swollen mouth away, and jerk Erwin with his fist, his own spit making it slick and wet. The sounds were loud in the otherwise quiet room.
Erwin didn’t last long, gripped hold of the longer strands of dark hair, twisting his fingers in them as Levi choked himself down on Erwin’s cock, pulling him from his throat as he came into his mouth.
“You used sex to distract me,” Erwin said when he could speak. Levi had tucked his soft cock away and swallowed the worst of the taste away with the glass of water. He clambered up onto Erwin’s lap, pressed up against him. Erwin moved his hand to Levi’s waistband, but Levi shook his head.
“Wasn’t about me,” he said, his voice hoarse from where Erwin had worked it. “You asked how we got together. What d’you wanna know?”
“Our marriage? Tell me about it.”
“We just did it on a whim one day.” Levi pressed his nose to Erwin’s cheek, who held him close with a hand wrapped tight to his waist.
“In Disney?”
“Not in fucking Disney World. In a courthouse here. My kid, some random witness we didn’t know. It was perfect.” Levi looked down at his hand, so Erwin did too, at the gold band nestled down onto his finger. Erwin thought of the one he had wrapped around his neck, but he didn’t look at it often. Still felt so strange. “You’ll remember Erwin. And what you don’t, I’ll be here to remind you.”
++++
Levi was purposeful in the distance he kept between the two of them now. Erwin always worked from the boundaries Levi set. He never showed up on a whim, never offered to take Isabel out, but if Levi called out of the blue, asking if he wanted to hang out, he went. And they fell into an easy rhythm. That’s what he had always liked about Levi; the easiness of the bond.
They didn’t always talk, but it didn’t feel awkward. He took a step back from school work to breathe, to help take Isabel to the park after school and watch her dangle upside down on the monkey bars as other parents referred to Levi as her big brother when they tried to get her to stop upsetting the other kids wanting a go.
“Hey big bro, look at me!” Isabel would laugh, dangling with her gangly limbs before Levi prised her from the bars and flipped off the other parents, announcing in a nasty manner that he wasn’t her brother at all.
Levi wasn’t his anymore, and they were friends, so he refused to look at him any other way. And still, he followed him home, and still he remembered how Levi always used to kiss him on the doorstep, whether he was invited in or not.
“Look at this,” Levi said once they had made it up to his apartment. Isabel had rushed to her bedroom to tell her cuddly toys about her day, and Levi pulled out a plastic Transformers lunchbox in his hand. Erwin took his favoured seat at Levi’s little kitchen table and looked curiously at it.
“A lunchbox,” Erwin said, anticipating the eye roll before it even happened. Levi pulled the box open and pushed it toward Erwin so he could see what was inside. He saw needles, a vial of testosterone, packs of alcoholic wipes and band aids padding the gaps. “Oh, shit.”
“Yup,” Levi said. “Only been a couple of weeks. I’ve been doing it with Izzy watching. Explaining it to her so she understands.”
“Levi, I’m really happy for you.”
“Thanks.” Levi bowed his head, snapping the lunchbox shut. “I didn’t think I’d ever get to a stage like this. Seems like the rest of it is achievable somehow.”
Erwin wished he could have been there too. When Levi got the approval, because he didn’t have his group anymore, and he knew Levi didn’t talk about this stuff with anyone. Erwin had helped him purchase his first binder. An intimacy that brought added investment into his happiness.
“Are you looking into surgery?”
Levi nodded. “Top surgery. I’m okay with everything else. I’m saving. Most savings go in a pot for Izzy, but I’m portioning some out. When I can save. I’ve picked another janitor's job up at an elementary school. It’s strictly after school, so I can fit it in when I’ve got Isabel with me.”
“Levi, you can’t work all the time. You’ll wear yourself out.”
“It’s fine.” He shrugged. “Stops me thinking.”
Erwin met Marie through a mutual friend, by complete chance. A birthday party in the smart open-roof bar, for one of his fellow would-be lawyers. The kid was loaded, and his parents owned a chain of local casinos downtown. They had the VIP section to themselves, though it was full to the seams with people Erwin hardly knew.
He had come under the guise of perhaps networking a little. It was easier for him to go out that way — if he associated it with career prospects. He started going out more, with Levi helping him delegate his responsibilities a little better.
Tonight, Erwin ended up drinking far too much champagne just to keep himself from leaving early. He had wanted to text Levi, just to hear what vile vitriol he would have at the idea of Erwin at such a function. Instead, he looked up to see a young woman clutching a glass of champagne, much as he was, standing in the far corner of the room, looking a mix of terrified and bored.
She was beautiful in a traditional sense; dark brown hair falling in styled curves to her shoulders. A red dress with long sleeves and a sweetheart neckline, a gold necklace framing her collarbones. She was curvy; the dress clinging to places that had Erwin determined not to look at. When she caught him staring, she waved awkwardly, sloshing the gold liquid over her knuckles. He approached as she licked them clean.
“Hi,” he said. “Erwin Smith. You look about as lost as I feel.”
“Marie. Yeah… you’re probably right.”
“What are you?” He asked, and when she frowned at him, he tried again. “I mean, what’s your job?”
“A woman.” Her face flinched. “Sorry. I hate champagne. It makes me say the weirdest things.”
“It’s all right.” He sipped from his own flute, watched her do the same. When she smiled at him, he relaxed for the first time. “Do you want to get out of here?”
They bonded almost over night. Marie was a realtor, a career she had fallen into quickly after graduating with an English degree at college. She was from California, but had come to the East Coast for college and hadn’t returned. She was looking at going back that way next spring. Better prospects for the career she was after.
“What career is that?”
“Oh, I have no idea. That’s just what I tell people when they ask why I want to go home so badly.” She touched his wrist when she laughed, her entire face scrunching up and he fell into it with her. She made it easy. Everyone that met her said they looked good together; tall and striking and handsome.
Between Levi sorting him out mentally after his reappearance in his life and Marie helping him romantically, things felt good for him again. His friends liked him again, and they liked Marie. Mike met Nana a few weeks later. They went on double dates. They went to the movies, and bowling. It was what his mid-twenties were supposed to be, in the way everyone wanted for him.
Seeing Marie had helped him overcome the challenge of fitting his life around Levi again. He didn’t have to worry about stumbling back into their relationship when he had a girlfriend now. He pushed the thoughts that seeped in at night. The way Levi looked in the half-light when he was half asleep and quiet, how he would burrow down against Erwin’s chest in the early morning chill, his icy feet pressed to Erwin’s calves as they lay tangled together. His laugh, as rare as it was, could sometimes move Erwin like nothing else.
And sure, he didn’t feel that crushing emotion in his chest when he looked at Marie, not like he had with Levi, but he could imagine it, imagine her fitting into the life he was supposed to be leading so much easier. She would enjoy being a lawyer’s wife, and he could tolerate being a realtor’s husband. Those were the kind of jobs married couples had.
Then he was at Levi’s apartment, a typical Saturday morning as they ate waffles. No real reason to be there, just because he could and because it was the best way to start the weekend. His phone kept buzzing. Marie giving him the rundown on her current clients and the unobtainable goals they were looking at with their dream home. He looked up to see Levi finish Isabel’s OJ as she sneaked off to watch late morning cartoons.
“Sorry,” he said, finally thumbing his phone to silent and popping it back in his pocket. He felt guilty, a nasty itch that had him wanting to scratch down to his own bones.
“Mike? Doesn’t he have something better to do than pester you?”
“It’s not Mike, it’s Marie.” Erwin said quietly. “She’s uh. Someone I-someone I’ve met recently.”
It hung between them. The tinny sounds of cartoons playing from behind them, as the reality of his words settled between the two of them. He looked up and Levi was staring down at the empty glass, his hand curled into a fist beside it.
“She’s really nice. Funny.”
“Yeah, all right.” Levi stacked the empty plates, piling them up in front of them before he moved to his sink, scrubbing them clean.
They didn’t talk of it again. Erwin sat and watched cartoons with Isabel for a while until he left.
Levi never asked about Marie — never brought her up, and so Erwin didn’t either. Sometimes he picked Isabel up from school and took her to the park or the library on the evenings that Levi worked overtime at his latest diner job, and afterwards they would eat dinner together at the cheap restaurant next door and they would talk about everything but Erwin’s new girlfriend.
“You don’t sleep over anymore,” Isabel said when Levi had stepped out to use the restroom. She was staring at Erwin over the crusts of pizza piled up on the plate. “How come?”
“Me and your dad decided it was better if we didn’t do that. So we could still be friends in other ways,” Erwin responded quietly. He wondered how much she knew. They hadn’t kept it from her, but she’d climbed into bed with Levi enough times when Erwin slept over to work some of it out. “I’d be upset if I didn’t get to see you anymore.”
“Yeah, same,” she said with a heavy sigh. “I don’t mind. Uncle Erwy, you snore real loud. Me and daddy used to laugh at you.”
Erwin felt his cheeks flush at her honesty, unsure how to answer. He smiled when Levi came back to the table and quickly changed the subject.
“I want you to invite Marie over for Christmas,” his dad said down the line. It had thrilled him when Erwin mentioned a girlfriend to him. He’d been worried ever since Erwin had tried to explain to him his relationship with Levi, and they had mostly ignored it when Erwin had admitted he’d broken it off those months earlier.
“It’s a little early for that, dad,” Erwin said, picking at the edges of his nails. “Plus, Levi’s coming. I don’t want to make things awkward.”
“It will not be awkward. I think it might be good to lie down boundaries for the three of you. Is Marie aware of your history?”
“Sort of.” In fact, Erwin had sat her down the night before. Intrigued as she had been at his relationship with Levi, he had tried to keep her out of it. It had only been when she had been over and Hange had mentioned Levi and Isabel that he’d explained to her. “Just friends,” he had told her, “almost something more, but we didn’t work out.” It hadn’t been much of a lie.
“Levi will be fine,” his dad whispered kindly. “And I want to see him and that little girl of his. You know how I liked having them in the house last year.”
“Yeah, I know.”
He tried to tell Levi in a way that laid the facts all out. It was always best that way. He never did well with being soothed, could always see through it. Still, he did it over the phone so they didn’t have to look at each other.
“You’re uninviting me so your girlfriend can come?” Levi said, misunderstanding completely. Erwin squeezed his eyes together and rubbed at the back of his head. “Because your dad asked me last week if I was coming and I said yes. Isabel’s really excited. I thought it wouldn’t be so bad now we’re actually talking.”
“No, of course you and Isabel are coming. It just, dad wants to meet Marie too. He wants to see all of us together. I just wanted to tell you because you haven’t met yet.”
There was silence. Erwin could hear Isabel singing out of tune in the background.
“I don’t know if I can do that,” Levi said honestly.
“I know,” Erwin said.
“No, you don’t.” Levi hung up.
There was no getting out of it for any of them. Levi hadn’t spoken a word to him since their phone call, although by the time Erwin and Marie arrived at his father’s house, Levi and Isabel had already been there several hours. Levi was wearing a bandana keeping most of his hair from his face, and a grey plaid shirt with the sleeves rolled to his elbows. He was rolling pastry with Isabel in the kitchen, and only nodded his head when Erwin tried to introduce him to Marie.
It was possibly the most uncomfortable dinner they ever had. Marie sat in the chair Levi had been placed in last year, although she didn’t realise and Levi was about as social as he always was. Isabel tore through her potatoes, much as she did last year, and left nearly everything else. Levi barely touched his food and Erwin felt drained, but forced himself to eat. Still, he tried engaging in conversation with his father. Lightweight stuff, local sports teams, and his father’s store, and the little blond boy that had recently moved in with Mr Artlet after his parents’ untimely death from a car accident.
“Leave them to it,” his father had said, coaxing Erwin into the kitchen with him when dinner at been demolished by the Smiths, rather than anyone else. Marie, by sheer luck, had extensive Disney knowledge and was engaging happily in conversation with Isabel, ranking her favourite princesses as Levi sat silent as ever between them.
“Do you approve, at least?” Erwin said.
“She’s lovely. You look good together,” he said. Then, a little quieter. “Levi will be okay, Erwin. It’s better this way.”
They gathered for gifts in the afternoon, once the food had settled and Isabel had waited long enough. Levi sat on the floor beside his daughter, Erwin and Marie on the couch, and his father in his armchair.
“Must suck being born on Christmas Day,” Marie was saying brightly to Levi, and though there was quite a lot of effort in her words, the cheeriness was clearly forced. Levi had accepted their gifts with quiet thanks, but had been non responsive most of the time. Last year, Erwin had overwhelmed Levi with his purchase. This year he had barely looked at the expensive tea twice.
“Never really celebrated,” Levi answered quietly.
“Christmas?”
“Either.”
“Oh,” Marie sighed heavily, looking to Erwin for help. He shrugged and wrapped an arm around her shoulder. For a moment, Levi looked up at him, a glance akin to murder before he turned away, at Isabel insistence he help open her new gift.
Levi disappeared into the kitchen at the pretence of putting on coffee when Isabel climbed onto the couch to show Marie her new toys. Erwin stared once at his retreating back, twice at his father’s concerned expression, before he followed Levi out.
“Happy Birthday, Levi,” he said, stepping into the room. Levi’s back flexed taut with muscles, anger obvious in the stiff movements.
“Remember earlier in the year?” Levi was saying when he turned to face Erwin. In his hand, he held the tin of tea. He placed it loudly on the side with a sharp bang. “I don’t want this gift. It’s not what you promised me.”
Erwin had to think back, back to the times he forcefully locked out of his memory.
“You wanted me to kiss you in this kitchen,” Erwin said quietly.
“Cheaper than tea.” Levi was looking down. The fight slipped out of him, muscles loosening and making him look small, a little sad. “Marie’s nice.”
“Yeah she is.”
“I thought maybe we — you know, we would come back here and you might change your mind, but then you went and brought her fucking back with you.”
“Change my mind?”
“My feelings aren’t as changeable as yours,” Levi said, eyes fixed intently on Erwin’s chest. “Though I don’t think yours are, either. You wouldn’t have followed me out here otherwise.”
“Levi.” Erwin swallowed thickly, listened to the muffled sounds of the rest of the house through the walls, even as Levi caught hold of his hands, slipping his own into them.
“Give me what you promised.” Levi pulled until his own back was against the wall and Erwin did nothing but follow, until their socked toes pressed together, until he was looking down as Levi tilted up, his wet eyes fixed on Erwin’s. “Give me this and I’ll get over it. I’ll try to get over you.”
Erwin did as Levi asked, pressed their lips together, remembering how they fit. Levi gasped, because he always gasped when they kissed, like he was shocked. He had such a kissable mouth, such pliable lips. Erwin sank down as Levi’s hands wrapped around his neck, as his mouth open and his knees buckled, and he was kissing Levi in all the ways he shouldn’t.
It went on for longer than it should, but Erwin couldn’t stop, not when his heart beat so quickly, to the point of pain, and touching Levi like this made him so lightheaded. He wanted to pick him up and take him upstairs, to hold him and kiss him and do whatever Levi wanted, so long as he was happy.
When he pulled back, Levi was crying, tears dripping down his face. He tried to catch them with his thumbs, but Levi was squirming, pushing at Erwin’s chest until he freed himself, turning away just as the door pushed open.
He was scrubbing at his face, sniffing heavily, when Erwin’s father stepped into the room, pulling his glasses from his face. He had seen nothing of them kissing, and yet looking between the two of them, read the situation for exactly what it was.
“Go clean yourself up, Erwin, then go back to Marie. She’s a guest here,” his father said, neither stern nor gentle. His words were not ones to be betrayed, as grown as Erwin was. He nodded and turned to see Erwin’s father gently close the door so that he was alone with Levi.
“Can I ask a question?” Marie smelled like chocolate and she tasted like it too as she curled up against him in his narrow bed that same night. Through the thin wall he could hear the high-pitched chatter of Isabel, full of Christmas spirit. Levi was less audible, but present, as he tried to calm her. Erwin held his girlfriend, drained from the emotions earlier that day. He had seen little of Levi when he had walked back into the room with Erwin’s father some time later. It was only to announce he was taking Isabel for a walk around the block to see the Christmas lights.
“What kind of question?”
“Are you Isabel’s father?” Erwin laughed at the notion. The absurdity of the thought broke the tension in the rest of his body. He was cracking perhaps, though still she poked his side, frowning. “Why’s it funny?”
“No, I didn’t meet her until she was a toddler.”
“I wondered if maybe it was an unspoken rule. Especially as your father has him here.”
“That’s because my dad is kind.” Erwin felt warm in his chest, thinking of Levi’s harshness and the kindness wrapped inside. How he had cried so openly, how he had agreed to let go of Erwin, as if a part of him had been hoping all this time. “I never asked. It’s always been the two of them.”
“You’re not curious?”
“I suppose part of me is curious to work out who it was that gave that little girl such red hair and such bright green eyes because they weren’t inherited from him, but those belong to the parts of himself that he hasn’t mentioned. Isabel only has one father, and he’s good.”
“I never meant to suggest otherwise,” Marie whispered. Her lips softened against his chest, kissing away any unspoken offence. He held her closer. “I don’t think he likes me very much.”
“That’s just Levi. It takes a while to understand him,” Erwin said, desperately trying not to think back to the evening, to Levi’s mouth moving against his, how it felt so different to kissing Marie, as nice as it was with her. The look on his father’s face, who hadn’t seen them kissing, but seen enough of the aftermath to figure it out.
“He’s my best friend, you know? No one knows me like he does.”
Chapter 6
Balcony
Things changed a little at first, and then a lot. Erwin graduated, he kept his head down to the wire and then, not long before summer, Marie got word of a job offer back home and while Erwin was still studying to pass the bar; he’d finish up in California, get a job out there.
He had a leaving party, thrown by Mike and Hange, who now in their mid-twenties and settled into their own relationships, had let the lease go on the apartment they shared. Hange called it an end of an era. Mike just grunted into his beer.
Even Levi showed up, face devoid of emotion as he pressed himself flat to the wall, fingers clutched around a bottle of beer. They never spoke of that kiss in his father’s kitchen, the gift Levi had wanted from him. They just moved around it, were cautious with each other and then were too busy for anything else.
“California,” Levi said, his features well schooled, barely a flicker of movement out of place. He’d practiced that, had gotten very good at it by Erwin’s reckoning. He hoped he hadn’t been the person who saw to Levi changing so much. He guessed he wasn’t far off.
“Yes. Marie’s from there. I think it’ll be good to get away from dad, and the business.”
Levi nodded, eyes drawing over to Hange and Mike chatting with a crowd of friends together. “Yeah. Let these idiots miss you.”
“I’ll miss you.”
“Don’t,” Levi warned. “Izzy’s devastated. She’s been crying every night about it.”
“Do you want me to try talking to her again?” Erwin asked, but Levi shook his head. Isabel had refused to speak to him when he broke the news to her that he was leaving, and was holding fast to her anger every time he’d tried talking to her in-person or by phone.
“You better not go having any kind of mental break out there. I’m not getting on a plane to sort your shit out.”
“I’ll bear that in mind,” Erwin said. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Hange trying to grab his attention, but he wanted to stay where he was with Levi, while he still had the choice. He wanted to say how much he already missed about how things had been before. When he’d been a panic-stricken law student, frozen with anxiety in his favoured booth in the greasy diner Levi worked in. Where Levi’s kindness had flooded beneath his grouchy facade.
“They’re trying to get your attention,” Levi told him, when Hange’s hands didn’t stop their waving. Levi was peeling the label from his beer, head tilted down.
“If I go see them now, I know you’re going to leave without saying goodbye,” Erwin admitted, grimacing when Levi stilled, just enough to make him aware that he knew.
“Don’t you think it would be better that way?”
Moving wasn’t easy, but it got him out from under his family, from the constant pressure. They had a small condo, rented for the time being, but with Marie’s career, she cut them a good deal. He loved his life, loved talking to his father about her, and smiled whenever someone said how perfectly matched they were to one another.
But he missed Levi. Missed him in ways that weren’t conceivable over phone calls and Skype. Levi, he knew, had internalised the move, and mostly refused to talk to Erwin about it. Often he would send Erwin photos and videos of Isabel, still as bright and playful as ever. He played them on his commute into the city, or brushing his teeth at the end of the day. Just snippets of her killing it at gymnastics, or reading comics aloud, or just gurning and saying good morning to Erwin, with Levi’s gruff prompting just audible. She’d forgiven him over time.
Six months turned to a year, turned to two and then he was catching a red eye across the country, sleeping in his childhood bed, and missing the light and bright of his usual routine. He felt the cold now. He spent three days with his father, fighting back the oddly phrased conversations about moving back home. He was missed.
He and Levi spoke often via text, but rarely over the phone. Levi had been sporadic in his responses, but he was too prideful to reveal his trouble with spelling and preferred to speak over the phone, however grumpy he came across.
They’d seen each other a few times after he left; Hange’s birthday bash, a few other in-town reunions, but Erwin had brought Marie back for every Christmas since, and Levi had never come back to his father’s house, not when they were there. Erwin could still taste his lips as he had that last time.
“You look like Izzy’s Barbie,” Levi said, opening his door to Erwin. He lived above a florist’s and the pungent smell of lilies filtered up the staircase from below. It was far nicer than the previous apartment, which had been so cramped, a small screen shielded Levi’s bed from the rest of the room. Now he had furniture that wasn’t fold up or plastic. A bedroom. Not expensive, but workable.
“I look like a Barbie?” Erwin looked down at himself as he followed Levi through. He’d wrapped up in several layers, a thin button down and heavy coat, a dark blue scarf that Marie had packed him off with. She said it brought out the colour of his eyes.
“The boy one — Ken? I don’t know his fucking name. You look all tanned and not like Erwin.” Levi was holding out his hand, his spare one hitched on his hip. Erwin shrugged out of his layers, gently placing them on Levi’s outstretched hand.
There was a small kitchenette painted a cornflower blue. A small leather sofa, aged enough to suggest secondhand, though immaculately kept. All the doors were open, the pink and yellow of Isabel’s quilt visible.
“Not your bedroom, I presume,” Erwin said teasingly, as he followed Levi through a tour of the place. Levi’s bedroom was next door; white linen stretched over the sheets. Pallets lifted the futon from the floor. Erwin through briefly to his spacious condo with Marie and felt a little guilty.
“She still doesn’t like sleeping in it,” Levi said, leaning against the door frame. “She still has pointy fucking elbows.”
“I remember,” Erwin said, touching his jaw as he recalled the time he had woken to Isabel throwing her elbow back at him, hard enough to leave a circular bruise.
They sat down for tea at the little table in the corner. There was a TV set and a scramble of cables behind it. A bookcase with books aimed at kids, a few sketchbooks. It felt friendly and warm. There were cookies cooling on the rack behind them, the warm smell of sugar enticing.
“You’re all domesticated,” Erwin said, watching for the faint flicker of a twitch at the corners of Levi’s mouth.
“I’m straight up bribing her with cookies after school because the thought of them is the only thing keeping her in that goddamn building. I want her to just stick at it, but she hates it.”
“Not everyone is academically orientated,” Erwin answered truthfully.
“Don’t want her to be a dumb shit like me.”
“You’re not. Please don’t talk about yourself like that, Levi.”
“Everything was easier when she was younger. I could just cart her around with me. Now I have to contend with slumber parties and kids being shitty brats and saying things to confuse her.” There was worry etched faintly between Levi’s thin eyebrows. They pulled together briefly. Erwin watched and felt sorrow. Before, it had been easy; Isabel had known nothing but her father growing up. Hadn’t batted an eyelid that the only family unit wasn’t any relation to her outside of him.
“About you?”
“About there needing to be two. A mommy and a daddy,” Levi inflected his voice for the last part, pitching it nasally.
“Ah.”
“She knows she came from me,” Levi said. “Now she knows there needs to be another person involved.” Levi had never spoken of Isabel’s other father. It had always been the two of them.
“Is there a chance he would come back into her life?”
“No.” Levi’s answer was short, and his face switched over briefly to a dark state. Erwin swallowed. He drank the tea Levi had poured for them. Thoughts about sleeping off hangovers at Levi’s old apartment, thoughts about Levi feeding him cake and tea when he was studying for his exams. Thoughts about Levi listening to his fears of failures. Wanting to live up to the Smiths of the past, beyond his father’s love and affection — his father who quit lawyering when it got too much. Who maybe didn’t lose his mind, but lost his thoughts enough that opening a little dusty antiques shop was all he had accomplished.
“You’ve always been a good friend to me, Levi.”
Levi looked at him over his own teacup, dark hair falling over his eyes, head tilted on the side just so. “Why you talking so soft?”
“I just want you to know that you mean a lot to me, Levi.” The but hangs in the air between them, much as it had done those few years before, where he had broken Levi’s heart in his old apartment, where he had rubbed salt into the wounds that following Christmas.
“California’s turned you to mush,” Levi said, chiding between sips of his drink, composing himself as much as he could. His eyes peeled to a caution, fingers fumbling over the teacup.
“Marie and I are getting married.”
The effect of his words wasn’t as obvious this time. Levi didn’t have to shield wet eyes beneath his hair, or hide his hands in his pockets to stop them shaking. In fact, nothing appeared out of sorts if it wasn’t for how he stopped blinking, eyes widening slightly before the long fan of his lashes closed once, picking up speed again.
“Oh,” Levi said eventually. “Congrats I guess. Is that why you’re here?”
The truthful answer was yes, because Erwin felt he owed it to Levi to tell this himself, not to let him find out through his father or friends. It hung in the air, the unspoken words from the last time they skirted the issue. The way Levi had looked at him in his father’s kitchen. Eyes closing when Erwin moved to kiss him, face wet with the onslaught of tears when they pulled apart.
“Not the only reason,” Erwin said. “I miss you. There’s no one like you in San Francisco. In the country. Ever. Sometimes I miss you more than I ever should. I just wish you were around to kick me into shape.”
“Right.” Levi sipped his tea, eyes averting Erwin’s. “When’s the wedding?”
“Next year, I imagine.”
They spoke for a while. Not so much about the wedding, but easier things that wouldn’t cause any more stress. Levi had had top surgery late last year, and now it was heading in to summer, he was looking forward to taking Isabel swimming for the first time. There was genuine excitement in his words. Erwin could pick it out under the flatness.
“You ever thought about meeting someone?” Erwin asked when Levi swung the conversation around again. It was between them, this sticky something, making the pull between them palpable.
“No.”
“Why not?”
“No one would want me, Erwin,” Levi laughed bitterly, caught the last part on a sip of tea. When he dropped his cup down on the saucer, he pressed his lips together. “And I’m busy. I don’t have time for a man between my kid and work.”
“Why wouldn’t anyone want you?” Levi was beautiful beneath the scowling and he was kind beneath the contempt, and he was gentle once the vulgarity was stripped back. Anyone would be lucky to have him, few would deserve him. Erwin counted himself in that section.
“‘Cause I got fucked pregnant when I was thirteen and I’m trans and I’m all this other shit that is too much.” Levi scrubbed the back of his own head, restless and pink. His grey eyes moved around the room, refusing to land on Erwin, who felt endless guilt. “I couldn’t even have sex with you when we were, you know, whatever we were.”
“There’s someone out there for you.”
Levi looked at him, with that piercing gaze that a lesser man would flinch from. Erwin forced himself to keep the stare steady, and it only broke when Levi looked away to sip at his tea.
“So, how much do you hate your job out there?”
“It isn’t so bad,” Erwin said, and that was true. He appreciated the routine of it all. He enjoyed his coworkers. It was deathly dull, and despite everyone’s high opinions of him, he felt a little wasted.
Erwin’s bachelor party was three days before the wedding and hosted at a high end bar downtown. Mike’s choice, best man that he was, and the man that still partied whenever he could. There was an odd knot of something in his stomach, tightening with every breath closer to the big day.
Friends from college came to the party. Even his father was around, sitting in the corner and no doubt wishing he was elsewhere. Everyone was full of deep congratulations to him; everyone said they were going to make the most handsome couple. They were a good match. In heels, Marie was only a little shorter. She’d recently highlighted her dark hair, lightening the ends to gold. It looked pretty when he stared at it from across the bedroom, when she sat at her vanity, brushing the long lengths.
Levi was there. Old enough to drink now, though he still had to flash his ID whenever he ordered. Erwin found him outside, sitting with his back to the glass doors, propped up against the fake fauna.
Levi looked handsome. A dark green shirt, buttoned down low enough that his pale collarbones were exposed. He looked good in green. Before, back when they were close, Levi lived in black, baggy and dark. After his surgery, and in certain lights, he wore clothes that took Erwin’s breath away.
“Smoke break?” Erwin said, taking a seat beside Levi, knees clicking as he made it to the ground. Down here, only the tops of their heads would be visible, or maybe just his. His toes touched the metal frame of the meshed balcony. Levi had his own drawn to his chest, but his eyes were on Erwin as he drew out a soft pack. He offered one to Levi, who shook his head.
“You’re an out-and-out smoker now?” Levi said quietly.
“Socially.” He grinned, sucking in a deep one, letting it sit before blowing the smoke out through the corner of his mouth. “Nerves are getting a little much. Marriage is kind of a big thing.”
“Isabel keeps telling all her friends about it. I’ve spent hours in front of dumb tutorials trying to get her hair how she wants it.” Erwin had asked Isabel to be flower-girl. He’d wanted her involved, and Marie hadn’t minded, wrapped up as she was with larger aspects of the big day.
“Does she like her dress?” Marie had picked it, a pale lilac to match the bridesmaid dresses.
“Sure. She wants to wear her light up sneakers with it,” Levi snorted softly, fingers folded over his knees.
“They sound perfect,” Erwin said, looking down. Levi was lost somewhere else. He put his hand on Levi’s shoulder, squeezing until he looked at him. “Are you okay?”
“All I want is for you to be happy. You deserve to be happy,” Levi said, staring down at Erwin’s hand on his shoulder. “Are you happy?”
For a moment, Erwin was struck dumb. Things he wanted to say swallowed back by what he knew was right. “It’s the right thing. It gets muddled in my head, but the plan — everything I worked towards — is falling into place.”
“Not really what I asked.” Their eyes met. Erwin swallowed thickly, scratched at the short hair at the base of his skull. “I can be the bad guy if you need me to be,” Levi said quietly. Behind them a litany of sounds, chattering and laughter. The rest of the group had moved inside, leaving the two of them with the smokers huddled in the furthest corner.
“The bad guy? You could never be the bad guy. Not to me.”
“If you need me to be, I can. We can leave now. I could get Izzy and we could just leave. New state, new life. It would make me happy. It would make you happy. They would forget. Marie would forget. I know it would hurt her, but she would be okay.”
Erwin thought about it for a moment; a life with Levi, who knew him without saying a word, with Isabel, who he loved as a daughter. He thought of Marie, her face when she came home with wet eyes to say she had found her dream dress. The life he had built with her in California, away from the stress of his family, and the love of a dear friend.
“I’m getting married tomorrow.”
“Yeah,” Levi said. “Yeah. It’s dumb.”
“Levi.”
“No, it’s okay, I know. Wasn’t sure if you knew I still, you know.” Levi was staring ahead now, a sealing off all emotion. “Isabel won’t shut up about tomorrow. She’s excited.”
“Flower-girl is an important role,” Erwin said, though there was no power in his voice, just the desire to pull back, to hide down here with Levi and all his love. “It was important to me that she was involved.”
“Yeah yeah. I need another drink. I’ll see you inside, yeah?”
++++
Erwin and Levi moved through the motions over the next few days. They ate breakfast together, drove off to their places of work in separate directions. They would meet up late afternoon. Sometimes Erwin would stop off at Levi’s teashop, but usually they met up at home. It was a new routine, one that ached with a familiarity that he still wasn’t used to. His days before, the ones he remembered, were spent almost dawn to dusk in his dry-cleaned suits, his office, the partners, the board meetings, the settlements made in expensive sushi bars with private booths.
They were at another practice for Isabel, after he’d spent the afternoon drinking coffee in Levi’s tearoom, watching him work, flicking through old photos he found of his father. Levi spent much of the time twiddling with the rows of tea lined up behind the counter, or wiping down surfaces, or fussing over Falco and Gabi when they came trudging through the shop. Gabi had a hole in the elbow of her blue cardigan, and Erwin watched Levi’s eyes fixate on it. He hadn’t been able to afford new clothes for either himself or Izzy growing up, but even secondhand they were always patched up neatly and clean.
He set them up on the table beside Erwin and they happily sat together, legs swinging as they whispered together. Between cleaning and tidying, Levi bribed them with pastries and honeyed tea, hiding the satisfaction on his face when they both thanked him, even Gabi.
They didn’t go home after closing but went straight to the rink to watch an open practice with Isabel’s team. Levi was allowed closer to the rink outside of game days, and so they sat together on the shiny wooden bleachers, a flask of tea between them, close enough that their fingers brushed together.
“I have no idea if I ever apologised for what I did to you back then,” Erwin said quietly. Levi fixated on the rink, but with his head inclined slightly toward Erwin.
Levi shrugged and handed the flask to Erwin again. “It was a long time ago.”
“I know, but still,” Erwin nodded. He drank his tea, swallowed down mouthfuls.
Levi gave a look from the corner of his eyes. “I hope you don’t think I was totally pathetic and caught up with you. I was too busy to give a shit most of the time. I might have been waiting for you, but it wasn’t like… like I wasn’t getting on with my life.”
“No, I understand that.”
“Good.” Levi took the flask back again, but didn’t sip, just twisted it in his hands after. Erwin looked at him, even as the swish of skates rolling around the rink filled his ears. Every so often, he could hear Isabel’s laughter flashing by.
“What did my dad say to you?”
“What?”
“That time he caught us in the kitchen.”
Levi turned to look at him. “Uh, nothing really. Fake platitudes about how it was okay to cry on your birthday. So I did, and then he tried to hug me. Didn’t wanna let him, but I was pretty upset.”
There was a moment when Erwin wanted to tell him that his father had been the one to tell him to break up with Levi, but he realised that wouldn’t achieve anything but make himself seem weak, and Levi had been close with his father, long after Erwin had left. He didn’t want to build a rift between them posthumously.
“What we did was cruel. I’m sorry we made you go through with that.”
Levi was staring at him, eyes blank, lips in a flat line. Then he shrugged a shoulder before turning back to the rink again. Isabel passed by, arms raised up and waving at the two of them. Levi flipped her off, and she hollered so loud, the girl passing on her left visibly flinched.
“It’s fine, Erwin,” Levi said, pulling back into the conversation. “I forgave you years ago.”
Erwin was seeing Mike after work. They’d been to the gym together again over a few scattered days, and Erwin ran with Levi during the week. His routine wasn’t what it had been, but he was building up. He enjoyed going to work every day and seeing Armin. The boy was always there before him, sitting behind the counter and playing with one trinket or another, or engrossed in a book, bent down over it, hair falling in his face.
Erwin would say good morning, and they’d chat amiably for a short while, but then he’d lock himself away in his back office, sit in his father’s seat. This time, Erwin stared out through the window, eyes drawn down to a small potted plant on the side. He suddenly realised that key to his locked desk drawer was beneath it.
It wasn’t quite a flashback, but just a piece of information that flooded back. He stood up and made his way over. He was gentle as he lifted the potted plant up, rubbing his thumb beneath it until he found the key taped to the bottom. He prised it off and the silver key bounced into the palm of his hand.
He held the key in his palm for a while. It wasn’t out of the ordinary; he decided. He always locked drawers before, in his office downtown; not stuff that needed to go into the safe, but personal writings and paperwork. He’d always used the same trick.
He slotted the key into the lock, satisfied when the catch caught, and it peeled open with a sigh. There was a slim silver laptop hidden in the drawer and some paperwork tucked beneath it. He lifted the laptop to slide out the pages. He dropped them to the desk and thumbed through them. Surprise bled into frustration when he realised what it was. A generic pamphlet on fostering with an attached application. On the very last page held a spot for their two signatures. Levi had signed weeks ago. It was still blank where Erwin’s name should go.
He placed the paperwork into a brown folder and placed it on the desk, squaring it up with the edges, because Levi would do something like that. Levi, who held so many secrets from him.
He wandered back to the front of the shop, just as he heard the bell ring over the door, two customers leaving after a long conversation with Artlet. Armin looked up from his position and nodded his head to him.
“Whats that?” Erwin watched Armin fiddle with a crescent-shaped necklace in his hands, a dark slick of leather threaded through a hole in the top.
“Magatama,” Armin said. “It’s supposed to ward off evil spirits. It’s an ancient Japanese symbol.”
Erwin wondered if he’d known that already. “Is it for sale?”
“No. My friend wants to purchase it for his girlfriend, but he wanted me to value it first. There’s a lot of knockoffs online. He wants to make sure it’s legitimate.”
“I see.” Erwin wondered if he knew of these friends, did he listen to Armin chatter away to him in the days he spent here, typing up submissions for journals, absorbing himself in his father’s world, pitying himself at the life he had lived before he had changed it all.
He wouldn’t bring Armin into his issues. He was a young man, and Erwin was his boss. So they chatted politely. Erwin asked questions and Armin engaged him enthusiastically, and then at the end of every day, they went their separate ways.
He drove straight to Mike’s from work, and re-met Nana and the dogs again, while he waited for Mike to finish up at the gym. The big blond scruffs jumped and slobbered all over him and he let them, patting at their soft fur, ducking from tongues that tried to get a little too close to his mouth. Levi would have a fit, if he knew. Levi. The foster application that sat locked in the glove box of his car.
He chatted with Nana, who pulled him down into a hug. Her hair smelled of chlorine, from the swim sessions she had taught earlier in the afternoon. By the time Mike ambled through the door, Erwin had, under strict supervision, prepared a large bowl of salad and the tuna-bake Nana had been perfecting since college was bubbling in the oven. The closest Levi let Erwin into the kitchen when he was cooking was on the other side of the counter.
This didn’t feel so different from the years he remembered. He’d come back every so often, not always with Marie, but he’d rock up to this same house, and eat with Mike and Nana, and they’d drink beer on the porch if the nights were warm enough, and talk shit until it was time to leave.
“How are things?” Mike asked when the food was demolished and replaced with beer. He cupped the bottle in his hand, looking across the table at Mike.
“Theres a certain disconnect,” Erwin admitted. “I only just found out about my new job. It was my fault for not asking.”
“He didn’t tell you?” Mike said, voice a little flat.
“He thought that finding out I’d divorced Marie, married him, and lost my father was enough of a shock.”
“Levi’s always been very protective of you,” Nana said levelly, sensing the tension. “I can see where he was coming from.”
“I get that.” Erwin did. He didn’t like that he had to find out from Armin, but still, his mind flooded back to what he had discovered earlier in the day and his mouth dried up. He cleared his throat, swallowed down a mouthful of cool beer. “I found paperwork in the drawer at work. Application for fostering. I had no idea that was a thing.”
“You were worried,” Mike said in his slow steady manner, even when Nana hissed at him.
“Erwin, you should probably talk to Levi about this and not us,” she said, turning her wide eyes toward him. Erwin scratched at his jaw, thought of the papers locked in the drawer that Levi hadn’t been able to open, hidden away as if he had wanted to forget all about them.
“I spoke to you two about it?” He asked, looking at his two old friends.
“Just because you would never be biological parents didn’t mean that it didn’t fuck Levi up having the miscarriage last year,” Mike continued, even with Nanaba’s clipped expression toward him. “You were concerned this was just a delayed reaction.”
“That’s enough, Mike!” Nana placed her hand gently on the table, eyes flickering from her husband to Erwin, where they softened. “Talk to Levi about this, Erwin, not us. It isn’t fair.”
“I worry about upsetting the balance,” Erwin carried on. “That he might grow annoyed that I remember nothing.”
“He has plenty he needs to tell you. Perhaps you need to ask more deliberate questions,” Mike offered, swallowing down the dregs of his beer as the dogs yelped in his direction, desperate to be let out for a final toilet break before bed.
“They’ve always been tetchy with each other,” Nana explained to him, seeing him off at the door with a Pyrex dish of leftovers and a kiss on each cheek some time later. “I’m sure Levi was plenty leery about letting you come see us.”
“He wants me to be with my friends.” Levi had been fine about it. “I feel like a clumsy oaf at times, like I get under his feet.”
“Well, that’s not new.” She rubbed his arm. “Talk to him.”
“I will,” Erwin promised.
Levi was already in bed by the time Erwin came back from Mike and Nana’s. The house was dark as he slipped his shoes off and stared down at the paperwork in his hands. In his head, he thought about what he was going to say to Levi.
“Are we fostering? This is about those two kids, right? The ones that come into the teashop after school, the ones you send off with pastries and rough words?”
It sounded desperate. He sounded a fool, and he was tired of not knowing anything. He placed the paperwork into the drawer in the kitchen where all the appliance manuals sat neatly stacked, drank half a glass of water, and made his way upstairs.
Levi was asleep as Erwin puttered into the bedroom and through to the bathroom. It surprised him. He’d always been a godawful sleeper. Was always good to burn the midnight hours together when Erwin should have been writing papers. Levi was always there, curled up with his tea and unhelpful words. Now he was curled on his side, dark hair spilling over their white pillows. As small as a child with his knees tucked to his chest, his little hands curled up by his face. Erwin sat in his own sleepwear watching him for a time, feeling his heart fill up with love and affection at the sight.
Erwin climbed into the bed, all thoughts of the conversation they ought to have fleeing his mind. Levi’s warmth pulled him close, his body scrubbed clean and scenting of soap, hair still a little damp. Levi wriggled close in his sleep, sensing Erwin’s warm body; Erwin’s arms tangled into the gaps they found, curling over the sharp angles of Levi’s body, softened by sleep.
A noise tugged Erwin from the depths of sleep. He’d been dreaming — that vacation he’d taken with Marie when they were twenty-four and barely grown. They’d scuba-dived in Cuba. He was skirting the seabed, the water blue, bubbles flying over his head as he breathed through the equipment, pushing lower and lower until he caught his foot on a sandbank and stumbled in his easy swim.
“Izzy, calm it. What’s happened?” Erwin jolted fully awake by Levi’s voice, still thick with sleep. Levi was sitting upright with his phone clutched to his ear and Erwin’s forehead pressed to his hip. He stroked his fingers over Levi’s side, felt Levi’s mirrored touch as he spoke to his daughter. “Did the cops show? No, that’s good you got outta there. Hang on, let me — I’ll come pick you guys up. Just wait for me in the diner opposite, yeah?”
Levi hung up and turned so that Erwin’s face settled over his lap. His fingers reached out easily, tugging through Erwin’s hair. “Isabel got in a fight. I gotta go pick her and Furlan up before the cops find ‘em. Or the cunts they fought with come back.”
“That bad?” Erwin asked, sitting up suddenly. Levi was already throwing the covers back, now that Erwin wasn’t on top of him, pulling leggings on over his briefs, and then Erwin’s sweater that he’d taken off only a few hours before. It swamped him. It made Erwin’s heart swell at the sight. Socks followed before his hands moved to tame his erratic bedhead. “She has your temperament.”
“Some dickhead started on Furlan because he’s gay. Furlan can handle himself, but she threw herself at them.” Erwin recalled similar parties when he took Levi along, harsh words thrown in his direction and Levi’s fists following through in defence. At times, it had taken Mike and Erwin to pull him back from his rage.
“Like I said, she has your temperament.” Levi smiled this time, leaning his hands on Erwin’s shoulders to push.
“Go back to sleep,” he said to Erwin, leaning over to press a kiss to the corner of his mouth. “I’ll be bringing them both back here tonight.”
Erwin settled himself in the parts of the bed, warmed by Levi’s now absent body, breathed in the scent of his shampoo where it had seeped into the pillows. It differed from what he remembered. The mattress was cheaper than what he was used to, but not worse.
Erwin drifted off the sleep for a while, but it was fitful and when he awoke, he felt even more restless than he had previously. He sat up once he heard the front door open, and the trudging of feet. He rubbed at his face, free at least from the headache that had once almost constantly throbbed.
He padded down to the kitchen, loud enough so that everyone could hear, although he didn’t want to interfere. He could hear Levi talking, nothing specific but the low hum of his voice. Erwin made tea and sat at the kitchen table as he heard the living room door open.
“… Go get some sleep. You know where the pain meds are. Message me if you need anything.”
“Night dad.”
“Thanks, Levi.”
Two pairs of feet softly tumbled up the stairs and Levi must have watched from the bottom for a while because Erwin was alone for a solid minute before the kitchen door pushed open and Levi shuffled into the room.
“Did we wake you?” Levi asked, falling into the seat beside Erwin. His eyes were heavily shadowed, hollowing down into his cheeks.
“No, but I thought you could use the company.” Erwin watched as Levi folded his face into his hands, elbows propped up on the table. “Are they all right?”
“Yeah. They’re okay. Ran into the wrong kinda people on a night out,” Levi said, pulling out of his own hands to fall backwards into the chair. He tilted his chin to stare up at Erwin. “They’re gonna crash here and then go home tomorrow. Makes me think… when I was Izzy’s age, I couldn’t afford to get into trouble like that.”
“I seem to remember you throwing a fair amount of punches.”
Levi looked up higher, thin brows sliding up and into his hair. “Well, only when you were around to get me out of trouble.”
“Hmm.”
They were quiet as they sipped their tea, the very start of dawn breaking from the outside. For a time, the creaking footsteps of Isabel and Furlan rose above their heads but eventually petered out and he presumed they’d fallen asleep not long after. Erwin finished his tea and looked at Levi’s tired face. He figured now was as good a time as any.
“Those two kids that come into the teashop. Gabi and Falco,” Erwin started, watching as Levi rubbed his hands over his face, his skin sallow and tired. “You want to foster them?”
Levi was quiet for a few long seconds, long enough that Erwin could hear his slow breath from across the table.
“We talked about it.”
“I found the paperwork. We did more than talk about it,” Erwin said, standing up and pulling open the drawer that he had stuffed the file into earlier that night. When he turned to the table, Levi was rigid as a rock, shoulders squared and chin titled upwards, defiant in an argument they weren’t having. “Levi, I don’t remember. Please don’t start an argument that I cannot defend.”
“You were dragging your heels at the paperwork,” Levi shrugged. “Said you would think about it, but never wanted to talk about it.”
Erwin fell back into the chair, opening the paperwork. Levi had already signed the last page, but it was blank for Erwin’s signature. A pinprick indent beside the dotted line, where a black pen had rested heavily.
“Did I not want it?” Erwin asked. Levi muttered something, and when Erwin asked him to repeat it, he simply shrugged his shoulders, a little defiant, a little grumpy. “Levi.”
“I could say anything and you’d believe me,” Levi’s tone became clipped, in the way it got when he was upset and losing his attempt at controlling his emotions. “Let me guess, you spoke to Mike, and he told you it was to do with the miscarriage?”
Erwin felt surprised, but realised from the tone in the conversation with Mike and Nana, perhaps he shouldn’t be. “Was it?”
“No.” Levi’s voice soaked in fury, his nose creasing as he tried to control his emotions. Erwin sensed his pain and yet could do nothing to the brick wall blocking his cascade of memories. He had nothing. Nothing at all. “I had one, and it sucked and I found it traumatic. Three months later, I find these kids living like I had to live, and I wanted to help them. There’s nothing fucking wrong with that.”
“No. There isn’t.” Erwin leaned over, clasping Levi’s hand in his.
“You were worried because you always worry. You worry about everything, and no one knows it but me, so it just fuckin’ festers and then dickheads like Mike blame me, like it’s my problem.”
“Tell me your reasoning,” Erwin said, thumb rubbing over Levi’s knuckles, keeping his voice as neutral as he could.
“Right now they’re just kids. I wasn’t a kid at that age. When I was twelve, I was drinking and smoking all kinds of shit. You know what happened not long after, and by fourteen I had a kid and they didn’t even bother finding a family because they knew no one would want me. I had to go to a group home for teenage parents, no one that gave a fuck. Not gonna let that happen to them. That would have been my thoughts before the miscarriage — I just hadn’t met them at that point.”
Levi’s life before Isabel was something they had never much spoken of. There was the deadbeat uncle down in Louisiana, and a mother he loved beyond words, dead before he could fathom what that meant. There were no photos. Baby photos of his kid, but nothing before.
“We would get approved,” Levi said, “I was a shithead growing up, but I never got caught bad enough to have a record. You’re a lawyer, I’m a business owner. I raised a kid and she’s alive — fuckin’ weird, but healthy. We have money, we have space. Yeah, we’re fags, but I think the good out trumps the bad. In their terms.”
“And now?”
“I still want to.” Levi turned away, his elbows sliding onto the table and his hands catching his face. He heaved a large sigh, and Erwin sat silently, watching him, waiting until he looked through his fingers at Erwin. “Maybe it’s not the best time for us with your amnesia, but I still — I look after them as best I can. So they have somewhere safe to go. Falco would come to me if anything happened, I think. Gabi doesn’t trust anyone, but she’s getting there.”
“She trusts you.” Erwin’s hand slipped to Levi’s back, rubbing over where he could feel the notches of his spine through his clothing. “Did we do this before? Talk things through?”
“Nope.” Levi lifted from his collapsed position. He leaned over from his chair to Erwin’s and wound his arms around Erwin’s neck, sighing. “You just kept saying you’d think about it but get shitty if I asked.”
“I see.”
Levi pulled back just as Erwin wrapped his arms tighter around him. At the awkward angle, Levi’s knee dug into the meat of his thigh and he shifted, but Levi moved with him, climbing gracefully from his own chair to Erwin’s lap, hands fisted in his hair for a moment before they took a graceful slide to his nape. Erwin shivered at the feel of short nails whispering through his hair, and the chill of Levi’s forever cold fingers.
“We’re in a fucking good place together, Smith,” Levi said, pressing his lips to the underside of Erwin’s jaw. It’s all he could really reach in a comfortable position. “Don’t let anyone say otherwise. Talk to me and not fuckin’ Mike about shit that doesn’t involve him.”
“Understood.” Erwin felt his cheeks heat, not with the chastising, that was something he was more than familiar with, but more the sense that they all knew how clueless he truly was these days when it came to the details of his relationship with Levi.
“Take me to bed,” Levi said.
They fell onto the bed with heavy sighs, both laden with an exhaustion even as they pulled each other from their clothes. Levi’s mouth opened to Erwin’s fingers, and he used them to slick him up, to ease the path and still Levi’s gasp sent shivers down his spine as he entered him, feeling the hook of Levi’s heels against his tailbone.
He could worship Levi’s body all day. He was all sharp edges; the bend and dips, the curve and notches of his spine as Erwin’s fingers slipped beneath him, pulling him close. His eyes were hot silver slivers when they closed. The flush of his cheeks and the gasp of his name on Levi’s lips every time he came sent shivers down his own spine.
Erwin had always been a quick learner, and learning Levi’s body over recent weeks was a testament to that.
He learned that fucking Levi as he spooned him was his favourite position, that he could get in deep and grasp and touch at Levi, who fucking melted to his front, face half pressed to the pillow. Levi loved oral, giving and receiving, playing with the metal piercing through his nipples would have him hitching a gasp more than anything else; that he enjoyed having his ass played with, that he liked Erwin’s fingers and tongue just as much as his cock.
He learned the bad, too. He picked up early on that Levi would go silently still when uncomfortable, that he had to ask Levi for his colour for him to vocalise that he needed to stop. If Erwin’s hands lingered too long over his throat, he would seize up. That dirty talk had to be particular and sometimes positions where Erwin was on top of him were too much, had him gasping out red when Erwin asked for his colour.
“You remember anything?” Levi asked afterwards, leaking between his legs as they splayed against their sheets. It had been over relatively quickly, exhaustion taking away any form of stamina. Erwin touched Levi’s stomach, watched his muscles tense and then moved his hand lower. When he lifted his fingers, they came away a little pink, though Levi shook his head when Erwin voiced concern. “You fuck like you remember.”
Erwin had never seen much use in lying to Levi. He'd always seen through him, or seen enough to garner a big enough bullshit monitor. But when he asked that, Erwin’s mind ruffled, it tripped up, and he didn’t want to hurt him, not when he was so openly vulnerable.
“A little here and there. Flashes,” Erwin said, stroking Levi’s sweaty hair back from his hairline, mirroring the smile that split Levi’s lips apart.
“I fucking love you,” Levi said, supporting himself on his elbows to press their lips together in a sweet kiss. “With all my heart.”
Levi didn’t speak like that normally. He was a man of action; how he’d feed and care for those two young kids, how he’s sat on the floor under the tall lamp darning his daughter’s clothes - how he had spent years saving up to take her to Disney World - possibly the least Levi place in the world.
Hearing the words sighed to him, in Levi’s blunt and flat tone — there was a heaviness in his chest. He’d known it, of course he’d known it, when Levi tried desperately at Mike and Nana’s wedding, when he had confessed and Erwin had denied him again and again. Quieter, at his own bachelor’s party.
Erwin pressed their lips together; kissed him hard, wanted Levi to know how he cared for him, for what he had done, even if he could barely understand why. Why had he waited? What had Erwin truly offered him?
And it was fine. It was okay, and Erwin opened his mouth and pretended that he remembered more than he did — never specifics, just vagaries - but they made Levi’s silver eyes flash, that rare smile flicker just briefly on his lips. He touched the ring he wore on the chain around his neck, wished heartily that he could recall the day Levi gave it to him.
++++
They married in his hometown, mostly at his father’s insistence. It was the same country estate his parents had married in, and really, Marie had no quibbles about that. Marie looked beautiful, and Erwin knew her well enough to know what kind of dress she’d pick, yet still was struck dumb by her beauty as she walked toward him in beaded ivory, the sheer veil. Long silk gloves that took forever to peel from her slender fingers as they exchanged rings. Nervous laughter bubble between them as they fumbled for the rings.
Most of it was a blur. Isabel went off piste as flower-girl, her hair braided in a way that he knew must have taken Levi forever. But she was young enough that the crowd just laughed sweetly at her until she was coaxed in hushed tones to sit on Levi’s lap.
Erwin didn’t look for Levi during the whole ceremony. He’d compartmentalised and shut down any lingering thoughts on what Levi had suggested during his bachelor party. Where would they have gone? Down to the Bayou that Levi had pulled himself up from, or hidden away in some Midwest town you couldn’t pick out on a map? His father would never forgive him for that and so—
So he didn’t look for Levi. He kept his eyes on his beautiful wife, and her bright smile, the way she pressed a kiss to his lips with her red painted mouth and almost believed she meant it as well.
Speeches came and went, and so did the food. They cut the cake and shared their first dance to a song they had listened to once, years back. Then he sat back in his ribbon-tied chair, watching the celebration carry on around him. He nodded his head to all the friends that came up to him, congratulating him on finding his perfect match. His father hugged him, watery eyed, smiling in a way that made Erwin flinch, but still he smiled back.
He danced with Marie some more, and her sister and her mother, and little Izzy with her braided hair half destroyed from a day of fidgeting. When he paused at the bar, he even saw Levi dancing with his daughter, twirling her around, smiling down at her in a way he didn’t smile at anyone. He refused to let his eyes linger for too long, focusing instead on fussing with the cufflinks digging into his wrists.
When Marie left to change into a slimline dress more suited for the evening, Erwin found his way outside and onto a balcony looking down at the estate. At this time of night, it’d be nothing but dark fields bleeding into the night sky. He was looking forward to the openness after a day of almost suffocating claustrophobia. On his way, he passed Isabel now curled up asleep out beneath Levi’s suit jacket, his father sitting beside her with his glasses half sliding down his nose.
The balcony had only one guest, though he recognised the sharp undercut anywhere. Levi must have sensed him, because as Erwin pulled open the doors, closing them behind him, he saw how his shoulders drew taut in his dark shirt.
“Congrats,” Levi drawled, eyes drifting to Erwin beside him. In the evening breeze, the ends of his hair bounced softly. He was neatness personified. Narrow body highlighted by the slim cut of his clothes, a dark blue shirt with the top three buttons left loose, his neck exposed, his clavicles shifting when he rolled his shoulders. He’d spent most of the day trying to avoid staring at him, but now found it hard to look away.
“Thank you for coming,” Erwin said, unsure what direction to take — the obvious; thanking him for coming despite their history, despite the minefields they avoid delicately these days, or thanking him as he had thanked his third cousin who he had met maybe twice. Either way, Levi would see through him, and he wouldn’t be subtle about it. Erwin cleared his throat, changed his mind completely. “I think Isabel had a good time.”
“Yeah. Thanks, I guess. For involving her.” Levi looked over his shoulder through the closed door, where his daughter was happily passed out.
“It’s not a problem.”
“I should get her up to our room before she wakes up all cranky,” Levi said, turning back to Erwin. He looked pretty under the lights, pale skin against his dark hair, against the drink-induced flush falling over his cheeks.
“Thank you,” Erwin said again, and pulled Levi into a hug. Levi froze for a few long seconds before his arms wrapped around Erwin, his drunken discontent muffled into Erwin’s crisp shirt.
“Hope you’re happy,” Levi said, lips to Erwin’s ear. “I hope this is what you wanted.”
Their eyes met. Erwin stared at Levi. Tried to imagine this day with him, but it didn’t quite work. There was family here that would never understand, and Levi would never have wanted this, even if he still wanted Erwin.
“I will be.” Erwin smiled, lifted himself up and away from Levi’s grasp. He watched his eyes flutter closed, watched him push his hair from his face before turning. From his viewpoint outside, Erwin watched Levi lean down and scoop his sleeping daughter up, folding her into his arms.
Three months had passed since the wedding and things had slipped back into the familiarity he had grown used to. Working, coming home to his beautiful new wife. They had spent their honeymoon in Italy, because it was the most romantic place he had thought of. They filled their condo with freshly framed souvenirs of their time; coliseums, and time-worn buildings, the two of them posing in front of cathedrals, lashings of gelato held in their hands. Wide smiles and dark sunglasses hiding the rest of their faces.
Erwin was at a corporate gala, bored out of his mind when his phone started ringing. There was only so much he could cope with when it came to greasing the hands of the elite and while he wasn’t actively involved, he was, according to his boss “the pretty face of the firm” and he was good with words, good with charm, though it all left him feeling a little nauseas.
Marie, after her first time at one of these, had laughed as she told Erwin he had to go alone this time. She was out with the girls; it was a night off after all. So it was a second relief when his phone rang, a friend catching up, or even his father grumbling down the line, wanting to know when he was visiting next.
“Do you remember that lawsuit you explained to me once? The dry-cleaning bill that cost millions?” Levi’s voice came through the line, reedy and oddly echoing, like he was in a bathroom, or some place else hollow.
“Levi? Is that you?” They hadn’t spoken in a few months. After the wedding, Erwin had been busy, and the things spoken and unspoken, well, they needed healing too.
“The lawsuit. Fuckin’ tell me about it. Or another stupid-ass one.”
Erwin slipped outside onto the balcony reserved for smoking. He found a way to a private corner, held his phone closer to his ear, plugging his other ear so all distant noise bled away.
“Fuckin’ tell me.”
“The lawsuit right,” Erwin stuttered briefly. “Why?”
“Just want to hear you talk.” A sniff. Levi was crying or had been, or was upset enough that his voice was shaking. Despite their history, despite having made Levi cry once in his father’s kitchen and in his own a few months before, he wasn’t one to emote.
“What’s happened Levi? Is everything okay? Is Isabel alright?” No, if there was something wrong with Isabel, Levi would have said straight up.
“She’s at a sleepover and that’s not—” Levi stopped to laugh, perhaps at the absurdity. “I’ve met someone.”
It was wrong of Erwins stomach to clench, a bite of possessiveness when he had pushed Levi away at every chance, had told Levi that he was happy and loved. Had asked why he hadn’t met anyone when he had confessed he was to marry.
“Oh, congratulations.”
“I don’t know.” Levi’s voice was quiet. “We had sex tonight. My first time since Izzy was born and—”
Erwin listened to the damp in Levi’s throat, the quietness of his tone. “Did he force you?”
“Like hell he didn’t. I wanted to it’s — after it all came back. Things that I — stuff you know.” Erwin didn’t, hadn’t asked but remembered those sweet moments between them when Levi had asked to wait, had wanted his time with Erwin to be special and mean something. How he had flinched if Erwin touched him without him realising. “I can’t get clean.”
The echoing of a bathroom made sense. Erwin stood straight and then backed himself into the corner of the balcony. He could be in the room with Levi, with how completely lost he was to his friend down the phone.
“Have you hurt yourself?”
“Fuck you.” As close to a no as he was going to get. “I can’t get the filth off me.”
“You’re not filthy. You’re loved.” Erwin paused, closing his eyes as Levi sobbed down the phone. “I’m sorry this has been your reaction. Your boyfriend - is he still there?”
“Not my boyfriend, or maybe not anymore,” Levi’s voice calmed down. “I made him leave. Was a dick. Probably won’t see him again.”
“Does he know any of your history?”
“Not really. He knew what equipment he was working with before the pants came off.” That hadn’t been what Erwin meant, but he didn’t push the issue.
“Get out of the tub, Levi. If you’re calling me now, then it must have been a while and you’ll catch a cold if you sit in cold water.”
“That’s a fuckin’ lie.” It might have been, but Erwin didn’t argue and felt only relief when he heard the wet splash of Levi standing up from the tub.
“Take some Advil if you need,” Erwin said quietly. “Get dressed into something warm and soft.”
“Starting to sound very bossy,” Levi said, but his protests were weak and Erwin heard the muffled sounds of him padding around the room. “What next, boss?”
“How are you feeling?”
“Like I wish you were here. Like I wish it had been you,” Levi said. “I just — you know how to handle me. Maybe if you’d fucked me before you dumped me this would already a’happened and I wouldn’t… maybe I’d be fixed.”
Something twisted in Erwin’s chest and he rubbed through his suit with the hand not grasping his phone. He wanted to say something, that he wished things had been different too. Practicalities, he reminded himself, pulling up from the sorrow.
“Did he use a condom?”
“Yeah. I couldn’t… not—”
“You don’t have to explain.”
“I don’t wanna be on my own.”
“You’re not. I’m here.” Erwin leaned his elbows on the balcony. “I’m going to stay on the phone with you, alright? It’s good he used a condom. Less mess for you to deal with.”
“I threw the sheets in the trash. I couldn’t. It’s like they were filthy and I—”
“Hey, it’s alright. Leave the bed as it is. You can change it tomorrow. Sleep in Izzy’s bed if she’s out. Or the couch.”
“The couch is okay,” Levi said. “Need to get dressed.”
“Something soft.”
“Okay.” He heard Levi’s drawers opening, the gentle rustle of fabric, and then the quiet of Levi’s voice as it came through. “What would you do if you were here?”
“Hold you,” Erwin said, looking up briefly, though no one was paying him any attention. “My arm around your shoulders, and your cheek against my chest so you could hear my heartbeat, so you could sync your breaths to mine. I’d stroke your hair because I know you like that, but I wouldn’t speak unless you asked.”
“He kept trying to talk to me, but he was saying all the wrong things and he sounded wrong. Like it wasn’t his voice.”
“It’s okay.”
“I wish you were here, I’d let you do that. Talk to me and shit.” He heard a rustle, imagined Levi curling himself up on the couch. His voice held a tremble to it - not quite crying, but the aftermath of a nasty shock, his body trying to calm itself down.
“We’d watch a movie. Something terrible that you get on those crappy channels late at night. You know the ones we used to watch after Isabel was asleep? And I’d make you tea even though you’d complain about how I steep them for too long, but you’d hold it in you hands and I’d hold you and it’ll be okay, because even if I’m not there, I am here.”
“Erwin,” Levi said quietly. It had been silent for almost thirty seconds after Erwin spoke, long enough for him to regret. Always smart enough to know when it wasn’t the time for apologies. “It was wrong of me to call, but I — you know all the shit, all the nasty shit. I know I never really told you, but you know enough, at least. I don’t — I don’t have anyone — There isn’t anyone else I could tell.”
“I know.”
Chapter 7
Lies/Truths
Erwin and Marie had flown back for a few days in the peak of summer. His father was celebrating a big birthday, and had invited just about everyone he had ever met over for a backyard grill-out. They hadn't been back home since the wedding, and Erwin was apprehensive to see everyone again. Ever since the phone call where Erwin had calmed Levi’s traumatic state, he’d been nervous. They hadn’t spoken as frequently, and even the usual photographic updates on Isabel had slowed. Not to a stop, but enough that Erwin missed his morning commute with the videos.
Marie, he knew, was relieved. She never spoke of it, but he understood why she was upset. His relationship with Levi couldn’t ever really be explained, and she ignored it rather than press on. He had no desire to explain it. They stepped into the warm house, crowded as it was with people he'd known from childhood. There were children running about, grandkids of his father’s old associates. A little blond boy was curled up in his father’s armchair, hiding from the party outside, twisted around a book, his mouth open as he absorbed the words. Erwin smiled at him as Marie kissed his cheek and went to announce their arrival to his father.
A light punch to his thigh had him shifting his gaze down to a scruffy haired little girl, her hair red and her wide grin broken up with the two black holes where she’d lost her front baby teeth.
“Hey uncle Erwy.” Isabel said, “five dollars and I’ll tell you where dad is.”
He opened his wallet with a laugh. “How about you take the money and I go look myself?”
“Alright.”
He found Levi in the kitchen, a fat baby on his hip, with rosy cheeks and soft brown hair, drooling down onto his wrist when he held it to his side. Levi was talking to an older couple that seemed vaguely familiar to Erwin, but who Levi seemed to know. The baby, he presumed, belonged to them; a grandchild, he'd imagine. After a few more minutes, Levi handed the baby over, fingers brushing softly over one round cheek.
For a moment, Erwin thought about Levi having another child, but the thoughts fell away when a man, a little taller than Erwin, walked over just as the friends drifted away. The man was thin, but with a thick blond beard and rounded spectacles. He placed a hand on the back of Levi’s neck, fingers curling in. Levi looked up at him, expressionless for a moment, before he twitched the corners of his mouth into the vague formation of a smile. At the neckline of his collar, he had a pair of sunglasses nudged, pulling down the fabric.
“It’s about time.” Erwin jolted when Marie was suddenly beside him again, her perfume familiar and expensive in the house that held the odd mix of everyone else’s sweat and sunscreen. Her eyes were on Levi too, and the mystery man.
Levi’s hair was a little longer than he normally wore it, though still with the severe undercut. The man’s hand cupped the back of Levi’s head as he bent down to kiss at his mouth. Levi let him and put his own hands on the man’s arms for a moment before breaking the kiss.
Erwin’s gut twisted, and his mouth seemed bitter suddenly. He looked at Marie, who had a look of almost being relieved on her face. He frowned, or must have because she stroked her thumbs over his eyebrows, in the way she did at night when he was frustrated from work and she tried to soothe the tension.
“Did you find dad?” He asked, and she nodded, twisting their fingers together and pulling him out, past the open door of the kitchen and into the throngs of people gathering in the garden.
Levi’s boyfriend’s name was Zeke Yaeger, and Erwin wanted nothing to do with him. He couldn’t quite pinpoint what it was exactly, as he said nothing particularly offensive when his father introduced them, when Levi became caught up with whatever disaster Isabel was causing in the back garden.
Erwin decided his biggest gripe was that he’d been the man to cause Levi’s devastation down the phone that time two months back, and perhaps also, he was the man that had fucked Levi; he was the one he had moved on from Erwin with.
He ran a start-up tech company and seemed perpetually boring, after awkward introductions were out of the way, Zeke slinked away to seek Levi out and Erwin turned towards his father, the two of them alone in the kitchen, as they moved to grab more refreshments.
“He’s, uh, well, not quite what I expected.”
“Is he not?” His father sounded almost amused, even as he pulled Erwin toward him. “It’s good that he found someone, don’t you think?”
There were words caught between them, words that had Erwin’s face heating because he’d found them that time in the kitchen, the devastation in Levi’s shaking shoulders and Erwin’s pale-faced shock, lips bruised.
“Perhaps you’re right,” Erwin said, nodding his head. It was time. Levi had wasted so long pining after him. What he had offered Erwin the night of his bachelor party, the uncomfortable things they had said to one another when Levi had called him in that terrible state. The sudden boyfriend had seemed like a whim.
He caught Levi briefly in the garden, after the sense that they were both trying to avoid each other. It hadn’t worked when Isabel had caught sight of him and grabbed onto his hand, pulling him over to Levi.
Zeke, thankfully, was ingratiating himself somewhere that Levi wasn’t. Levi was sitting on the brick wall in his father’s garden, sunglasses shielding his eyes and taking up most of his face, a glass of soda in his hand. He looked down at Isabel fondly, handing over his drink when she made grabby hands toward it.
“You behaving?” He asked, head tilted down at his daughter. She just shrugged a shoulder.
“I found a cat, but it ran away. If I find it, can I keep it?”
“No.”
“Please?”
“No.”
“I’ll be good for a week…”
“You wouldn’t make it a day, kiddo.”
“I’d do anything for that cute kitty.”
The debate went on for a little longer before Isabel drained Levi’s drink and handed the empty back to him before skipping off. Erwin watched her go with a smile on his face.
“She’s gotten big,” he said, remembering how she had been when he first met her, small with chubby hands, holding onto the last vestiges of her toddlerness.
“Yeah,” Levi said. “Brat’s getting bigger and mouthier. She’s seven next birthday, can’t really believe it.”
Nor could Erwin, but he nodded his head all the same. He took a seat beside Levi on the wall, looking around at the crowded garden, filled as it was with his father’s loved ones. Even after locking himself away in that dusty little store of his, he still found a place for himself, with so many people that loved him.
“So uh, Zeke…” Erwin turned to stare at Levi. He smelled faintly of the same cologne that Zeke had, like they either shared it, or it had rubbed off on him. Levi stared back, face unblinking. “He’s the one that you…”
Levi flinched, fingers twitching on his lap as he shrugged a shoulder. “We worked it out.”
“He hasn’t hurt you again?”
“He didn’t hurt me the first time. It was my own stupid reaction. We work on it. Stuff that works.” Levi shrugged his shoulder, but his face was darkening under his shades.
“You can call me if you ever need to.”
Levi laughed, but he wasn’t amused. “That’s the last thing I should do. You have a wife.”
“I know.” Erwin’s lips pursed, and he counted the seconds as he tried to gather his thoughts. “It’s — well. I’m glad for you. You deserve to be happy.”
“Shut up,” Levi said, hopping down from the wall and stepping away.
When everyone had left his father’s that night, it was just him and Marie curled up in his old bedroom, the window open to pull in some cool in the stuffy air. His ears still rang with the chattering laughter, his mind still burned with the sight of Levi in those sunglasses, of him being kissed by Zeke in the kitchen.
“I’ve been thinking,” Marie whispered, bringing him out of his thoughts. Her hair tickled beneath his chin, and when he leaned down, the sweet vanilla scent of her shampoo was almost intoxicating. “Seeing all those kids today. Makes me wonder whether it’s time we make some of our own.”
Erwin was almost certain he stopped breathing for a moment, soaking in her words. His thoughts immediately fled back to Levi earlier in the day, where he’d held a baby on his hip. It was wrong. Guilt flooded his chest, and he held on tight to her shoulder, rubbing it to distract him.
“Maybe in a year,” he said, because a year was forever away, and maybe then it would feel right. Perhaps whatever darkening pressure on his chest and in his lungs would fade into something else by that point.
++++
There was a pale blue Fiat parked in their driveway when Erwin returned from work. He scanned through his mind for the familiarity until he fumbled across the comment Hange had made regarding Pieck’s car when they’d given him theirs.
He found Pieck in the kitchen with Levi, photographs scattered across the table between their cups of tea. Levi looked up and smiled, almost, or at least his features lifted for only a moment.
Pieck was beautiful, a fact Erwin wouldn’t deny. Long dark hair, and a strong nose, slight and smelling faintly of geranium oil. She had shadows beneath her eyes that rivalled Levi’s, though he remembered in the back of his mind the comment about her working in the hospital. Shift work could do that.
“Pieck?” Erwin said, holding out a hand. He took hers within it and held back his surprise at how strong her grip was. “Nice to meet you again.”
“Still as polite,” she said, sliding her hand away and looking across at Levi. Erwin leaned down and kissed his husband’s cheek, bouncing the top of his nose into his hair for a moment. He glanced down at the table and saw photographs laid out. “How was work?”
“It was fine. Sometimes I think I bore my young assistant to tears,” Erwin said, smiling somehow when she did, as if it was infectious.
“Oh please. Like he hasn’t got the biggest boner for you,” Levi muttered, standing up.
“I should go,” Pieck said, but her eyes were on Levi, as if she was fixing for him to say something. He shrugged, but Pieck lent over and hugged him all the same. Erwin smiled, looking at the way Levi patted her back awkwardly. “I’ll see myself out. I’ll let Moblit know you’re both coming to his opening night.”
She moved past Erwin fluidly, walking through the hallway to the front door quietly. As the door closed behind her, Erwin turned to see Levi stacking the photographs back into the shoebox. Erwin hadn’t even had much of a chance to look at them. He felt a little like he was in the way again and moved to leave the room when he realised what Pieck had said.
“Opening night?”
“Yeah, Moblit’s got some bougie artist party at one of his galleries downtown. We’ve been invited.”
“Ah, I see.” Erwin nodded his head. It would be nice to get out with Levi, to see their friends together.
“So uh. Pieck said it would be good if I talk to you more about stuff. You know, because I keep hiding shit from you,” Levi said, sounded like a scolded child more than anything else.
“Open communication goes both ways. I keep fixating on the way I used to treat you.”
Levi nodded his head. “Yeah. I’m not — will you sit down and stop lurking in the doorway? I might be able to say some stuff. Not all of it, but maybe how I met Pieck.”
Erwin nodded his head this time and stumbled his way into one chair. Levi had now stacked the photographs back into the box. Erwin hadn’t recognised them from the brief moment he’d glanced at them.
“So you met at the hospital?”
“Yeah.”
The silence afterward was so heavy that Erwin wished he had something in his hands to fiddle with. Instead, he sat up straight, focused in on Levi, waiting for him to continue speaking.
“When I got pregnant with Isabel, it uh. It wasn’t exactly planned. Was a shock, you know? My mom was dead. They’d taken me away from Kenny. The one time I had foster parents that gave a shit, they rejected me when they found out, so I just… I wanted her really badly because it gave me an opportunity to have a family. But I also hated what it did to my body. It was a shitty time.”
“I can’t imagine,”
“My worst nightmare was having a miscarriage or stillbirth or something. Maybe it’s like that for everyone, but she was my only family. I didn’t have one otherwise. She came out screaming, and alive, and I think I kind of forgot about the fear the further I moved away from pregnancy. I wasn’t going to have anymore. Went on T, got top surgery, and then married you, and loved you and fuckin’ woke up one day with blood between my legs and it just all came back at once.”
“Went into this weird state of shock. Couldn’t move, Couldn’t talk. I’ve dealt with flashbacks. You know how they are.” Having had his own, Erwin nodded his head. “It wasn’t like that exactly. Different. You made me go to the hospital to get checked out, but I hate doctors. I fuckin’ hate them for how they treat me, and they wanted to sedate me because I wouldn’t calm down, but then Pieck was there. I don’t know. She was calm, she used the right pronouns, said she understood and helped me through the process. Even afterward, when they made sure it was all gone, she stayed with me.”
“Was I there with you?”
“I think so.” Levi’s eyes met his for a moment before slipping away. “It’s hard to remember. I really hate talking about shit like this, Erwin.”
“I’m sorry.”
“Whatever. She hooked me up with Onyankopon and I have an outlet now or whatever. I thought it was bullshit, talking, but I guess it works. He specialises in childhood trauma. Got a lot of that, I guess.”
“It’s good you have someone to talk to.”
“Yeah. It wasn’t a good time for me. I was miserable. You’ve always been the mentally unstable one, so it was hard.” Levi’s words were pointed, but not cruel. Still, Erwin chuckled a little nervously.
“Did I take care of you?” Erwin asked. Probably not, he figured, if the earlier aspects of their relationship were anything to go by.
“Yeah, you did. And I got better.” Levi rested his hand on Erwin’s, patting it lightly before Erwin turned his own hand over so they could link up. “And then these two dumbass kids came into my teashop, and I swear it wasn’t anything to do with the miscarriage. It was shitty of Mike to suggest it was and it was fuckin’ cruel of you to back him up with it.”
“I’m sorry.”
“Yeah alright. Stop saying that.” Levi shrugged, scowling half heartedly at Erwin before turning his head to the shoebox. “I found this earlier. Pieck wanted to go through it with me. It’s old shit. Photographs of my mom and Kenny. And this, look at this.”
Erwin watched as Levi lent over, pulling the shoebox toward him and fumbled for a photo. He pulled out a well-folded scan, worn white where lines had pressed, like someone had opened and closed it many times. He flattened it and handed it to Erwin.
It was a sonograph. Levi’s deadname printed across the top with his date of birth and date of scan. Erwin couldn’t see much of anything more than the grey swirls of Levi’s abdomen.
“That’s the day I found out,” Levi said, resting his forehead on Erwin’s shoulder as they looked down at it together. “I carried it in my pocket the whole time I was knocked up.”
“Have you ever shown me this before?”
“Nah. Always been too embarrassed. Not shit I enjoy talking about, but I guess I have to. There’s stuff you need to know that I haven’t said, but I will. I just need time.”
“You need time to tell me the truth?”
“Fuck you. You’ve not exactly made it easy.”
“I know.” Erwin rubbed at his forehead, clean as it was now. “Can I see some more photos?”
“Sure. I’m not in any of them, anyway. All before I was born.”
Levi was careful as he handed over each individual photograph. He’d never seen photos of Levi’s mother. There was a striking resemblance. She was young, Erwin could tell, but she had a mane of thick dark hair folding down to her shoulders, the same pointed features and high, slanted cheekbones as her son. Thin, wiry, but perhaps a little taller.
“She was beautiful.” Erwin had grown up with photos of his mother around the house, couldn’t quite make out her features from memory but well used to her honey-blonde and bright eyed expression in family photos hung from the walls. Levi had photos of Isabel up, scattered around the house but never anyone else.
“She got all the good genes. Look at this piece of shit.” The next photo showed a man in a sleeveless vest, his bare arms wiry, a rifle pointed down the lens of the camera, thin lips stretched wide to show off rows of yellowing teeth. On his head, a cowboy hat was perched askew.
“Your uncle.”
“Yeah,” Levi said. “He was with me when I gave birth. Forty fuckin’ hours in that shitty hospital bed and the only company I had reeked of stale moonshine and smoke. He bitched the entire time, but he saw out the shitty staff whenever they called me the wrong name, and he smiled like a dumbass the first time he held Isabel.”
“I didn’t know any of this.”
Levi shrugged a shoulder. “Difficult to talk about.”
They’d spent a few evenings together, him and Levi, but Levi wasn’t always willing to talk and when he did, it was never about things that Erwin expected. Never about their wedding, or relationship, or how he came to move in. He didn’t want to push, not when he’d known how hard it had been for Levi to open up as he had about the miscarriage.
Every so often he stared at his slim laptop he’d found locked in the drawer at work, but it was locked and no one knew the password. Levi barely touched his computer at work. His tablet seemed to be permanently resting on the dresser in their bedroom.
“What did you use to unlock your phone?” He said, when Erwin asked for the third time, as Levi prepared to press their shirts in the kitchen. It was Moblit’s artist installment at the gallery, the one they’d agreed to attend. Isabel’s rucksack momentarily distracted Levi, dumped onto the table not five minutes ago.
“It recognised my face,” Erwin said. “There could be important stuff on there. Emails from the college. Stuff that could help me remember.”
Levi’s lips pursed before he looked down at the bottle of pink lemonade he’d pulled from Isabel’s rucksack. “I’m your husband, not your secretary. Don’t act like I should know this shit. Hange will be able to crack it if you're desperate, or Furlan.”
At the mention of her best friend, Isabel rounded the corner, stumbling into the kitchen. Levi handed over the bottle in his hand, looking at her suspiciously.
“What kind of shit name is Pink Hooch?”
“Sounds like a stripper name,” Erwin muttered, smiling when Isabel cackled.
“It’s only hard lemonade, dad. I’m hardly gonna get drunk on it.”
“You’re not old enough to drink,” Levi reminded her, but he was hardly one to talk. Erwin remembered downing plenty of beer with Levi when he’d been underage.
“Furlan bought it. He is legal,” she said, though they were all aware it was bullshit. “Anyway, like I said, it’s hardly going to get me drunk. I’m skating tonight, working the rink.”
Isabel had pink eyeshadow blended all the way across her sockets, and up beneath her darkened brows. Over the top, she’d lined her lids with a bright shimmering gold. Her hair had more of the glitter sparkling in it, parted into two pigtails.
“It’s roller disco night,” she said matter-of-factly, when Levi grumbled about her appearance. “Dad, you should come. Though you might pop a hernia at the sight of all the loose glitter.”
“I wouldn’t want to cramp your style,” he told her flatly, wrinkling his nose when she leaned in. “That perfume is disgusting.”
“I know!” She clapped her hands together and stood up. Her leggings were foil and silver, like the scales of a mermaid. Erwin laughed softly to himself, smiling at her.
“Anyway, we’ve got to go to this dumbshit gallery thing,” Levi said, pulling a dark blue shirt from a hanger and draping it over his ironing board. He swiped the iron over the fabric, pressing steam beneath the collar, and he disappeared for a moment beneath it.
He knew the reason Levi was gloomy about it was because Mike was going to be there. He hadn’t known at first, and seemed relatively okay about it, but then Erwin had come back from a gym session to say Mike and Nana would be there, and Levi had turned an almost green for a second.
“You guys have a really good time,” Isabel said, when she had finished her makeup, and dumped her bottle of Pink Hooch back into her rucksack. She leaned over Levi’s ironing board, where he was pummelling Erwin’s shirt free of creases, and kissed his cheek. She did the same to Erwin and then bounced out of the room, the front door slamming behind her.
“Why are you so uptight about seeing Mike?” Erwin asked on the drive to the city. His shirt felt stiff where Levi had starched it to death, but Levi looked handsome beside him, a plain black button-down, embossed with flowers if you caught it in a certain light.
After Levi’s confession about the miscarriage, and Erwin’s sincere apologies about his behaviour, he hadn’t wanted to poke any further. Things felt so fragile. He’d been reluctant to discuss it with Mike any more. Mike had dropped the subject. They talked about everything but Erwin’s marriage. It was better that way.
The gallery was packed when they arrived, filled to the brim with the bougie society that had Levi’s lip curling in disgust. He leaned in close to Erwin, who tucked a hand over his shoulder.
Erwin moved through the gallery, looking for faces that were familiar to him. The heady scent of mixed perfumes set his head to throb as they moved through the gallery, and he felt a little underdressed in his button down and smart jeans. Levi had come dressed in black for a funeral; for comfort.
After a while, Pieck waved them over, dressed in a purple cocktail dress, her curtain of black hair hanging in loose waves. She grabbed Levi’s hand and while he gave her a filthy look; he didn’t push her away. Erwin purchased them all drinks and stood with them for a while, before deciding to go find Hange.
Hange it turned out, found him.
“Oi Erwin!” Hange had dressed even worse that he had and Erwin was pleased Levi was at least not in the vicinity to cuss them out. Their blazer was grey, their pants green, with paint splattered boots hastily laced. Erwin didn’t comment, only let an amused smile flatten his lips as he clasped a hand on their shoulder.
“Hange, I’ve met Pieck a few times now. I forgot to mention it to you.”
“Oh, yes — what do you think?” Their eyebrows rose above their glasses as they lent in close.
“She’s very beautiful and very polite. I’m sure you’ve put her through the ringer.”
“Absolutely.” Hange grimaced, self-aware enough to do so before they blew their bangs from their face. They had their hair down for the night, and it hung in shaggy layers about their shoulders. Their glasses were still crooked and smudged, but they had made an effort. “I like that she comes to these things. We’re not at a three-way level yet, but close!”
“Enough,” he said, grimacing as he pictured the three of them together. “Show me around.”
Hange did, and Erwin tried his best to take in the artwork, nodding politely every time he was introduced to an artist. He had never been one for this type of world. Had been happy to let Marie furnish their apartments and house, to brighten the walls with art that he enjoyed looking at, but couldn’t tell apart.
He quite liked classical pieces, or at least where he could tell what exactly was happening in the images. Moblit had always been fairly linear in his skills; charcoal portraiture mainly, but the artwork adorning these walls was “Mumbo Jumbo post-modern bullshit—that’s what Mob said when I asked,” Hange supplied, as they stood in front of a choppy red and blue ink monstrosity, adorned with gold leaf. “But hey, he puts these things on in the gallery and they bring in the big bucks.”
Mike and Nana wandered by just in time for Hange and Erwin to disentangle themselves from an awkward meeting with the artist of the gold leaf painting. They both turned to their old friends with half-hidden smirks on their face.
Mike and Nana looked striking; Mike with his height and ability to pick a tie that best brought out the vivid blue of his wife’s eyes and Nana’s ability to look so goddamn striking in nothing but a slim black cocktail dress and her soft blonde hair curled a little more forcefully than natural.
They said their hellos. Erwin pressed a kiss to Nana’s powdered cheek. She smelled like Mike’s cologne, the way Levi smelled like his.
“Where’s the little one — sulking at home?” Mike asked good-naturedly, but Erwin still gave him a cautious look.
“He’s on a playdate with my one,” Hange said, overly chirpy. “Probably conspiring under the table somewhere. They do seem to have all the fun.”
Erwin changed the subject. He complimented Mike’s tie and Nana’s dress and watched them both roll their eyes at him, well used to his compliments that were not quite hollow but spoken just to butter them up.
At one point they bumped into a red-cheeked Moblit, who was being tailed by three rather impetuous art critics. He’d scrubbed up nicely. Even his shoes were glossy and slapped against the tiled floor with every scurrying step. He stopped in front of Hange, kissed their knuckles when they offered him a glass of champagne snatched from the tray of a passing waiter, before he introduced them to another artist on show for the night.
“Everything okay?” Mike asked eventually, when Hange drew for breath and they stopped to mill around the sculpture room, less crowded than the rest of the place.
“Yes. I spoke with Levi about the fostering situation and he cleared it all up.” They hadn’t spoken of it in all their time at the gym, but he wanted Mike to know, as Levi was with him. It was bound to be awkward.
“Cleared it up?” The inflection in Mike’s voice suggested he presumed the opposite had happened. Erwin turned to him, watched him rest his elbows on the white support beam for a sculpture of a rather hideous bust.
Levi’s comments about the two kids — Gabi in particular — were deeply personal and not anything Erwin would ever dream of revealing to Mike, nor his feelings regarding his miscarriage, but he said what he could. “Levi was a foster kid, and he felt passionate enough that he could help them when no one helped him. He has a point.”
“So, are you going to foster them?” From the corner of his eye, he saw Hange attempt to engage Nana in looking at photos on their phone, to dispel the discomfort at the conversation, he’d bet.
“He agreed it wasn’t the right time with my brain injury. It’s on hold.”
“And what about before?”
“I was evasive about what I wanted,” Erwin said, this time with less determination, particularly when he saw the way Mike’s face flattened. “Caught up in discussions with you rather than him.”
“I suppose you know that because he told you.”
“Are you suggesting he’s lying?”
Before Mike could answer, the glass doors leading to a small courtyard opened and Levi and Pieck came in, the two of them so slight and dark-haired from a distance perhaps they’d be siblings. Erwin laughed to himself at the thought — about as much as one could mistake him and Mike for brothers.
“What’s funny?” Levi asked, grey eyes sparkling as he stood beside Erwin. He smelled faintly of cigarette smoke, and the frigidness from the cold. Erwin loved him, he truly did, so he made a show of his affection by putting his arm around Levi and pulling him close.
“How sweet,” Pieck said, a smile small on her lips as she looked at Erwin. Levi, who was not openly affectionate outside the house, leaned into him briefly, and rested his hand on Erwin’s chest, patting awkwardly.
“There are a few things he’s not being truthful about,” Mike said loudly. For a moment, Erwin looked at him, confused. Beneath his arm, Levi froze. “Isn’t there, Levi?”
“If this is about fostering, you can go to hell, Mike. We already spoke about it and I told the truth.” Levi slipped out from under Erwin’s arm, coiled up like a pissed of cat. “Stick that huge fuckin’ nose in your own marriage and leave it out of mine.”
“You didn’t have a problem involving yourself in Erwin’s previous marriage, or are we still pretending that was happy sailing too?” Mike’s words were flat enough to sound almost rehearsed. His eyes fixed down on Levi, whose shoulders drew into a straight line, standing as he was now between Mike and Erwin. Pieck made a small, oh sound, and Hange coughed awkwardly before making their excuses.
“What are you talking about?” Erwin said, refusing to fall into the frustrations of the blank memories of his dull but happy marriage to Marie.
“You fucked him in your marital bed,” Mike said, eyes suddenly on Erwin. “You were married to Marie when you guys got together. She found out and kicked your ass out. I suppose he left that part out.”
Erwin felt sick, felt his knees give way because — no — he had promised he would not be that guy to anyone. Had spent years furiously pining but never acted on it, even when Levi tried to pursue him.
His stomach clenched at the idea of hurting Marie in that way, of being that man. He recalled Levi’s soft awkward words the night where they made love, where he retold their first time. His comments about Erwin’s marriage being over before they got together.
“Levi?” Erwin asked, suddenly aware of the sound of Hange calling for people to gather in the first hall, so that Moblit could start the round of speeches for the night. “What’s he talking about?”
“I kept quiet for your sake,” Mike said, eyes fixed on Erwin. “But I’m not letting him lie to you anymore.”
“Shut the fuck up, Zacharias. You don’t know a goddamn thing about anything,” Levi hissed, moving in as if to attack. Erwin grabbed his shoulder, squeezed his fingers down. Levi, his friend, the one he had loved but let go all those years ago. Who he was with, who he cared about, but struggled to find in this new relationship. Where he couldn’t remember a thing between that one kiss at their friends’ wedding and now.
“If you guys could give us a moment,” Erwin said to both Mike, Nana and Pieck, as he felt the bottom fall out from of this marriage, of this relationship with Levi. He steered Levi to the glass doors and pushed him through it once opened, slamming it shut behind him.
The courtyard was empty except for a few stragglers smoking in the far corner, deep in a conversation.
“Levi — you said… you said you wouldn’t fucking lie to me. You said my marriage with Marie was over.”
“It never fucking began, did it?” Levi was bristling - aggressive and ready to strike. Erwin kept his distance, tried to count the lies. Every time Levi had smoothed over their history when reality was clearly something else entirely. “We never fucked in your bed. He’s lying about that.”
“Levi… You said we got together after my father died… that we grew close.” Something caught in Erwin’s chest; the humiliation of being lied to, of believing the lies, Levi thinking that differentiating between the places they had been caught made any actual difference. Humiliation sank and anger burned in its place. He stared at Levi’s small pointed face, the panic he saw in the quickening of his breaths. “I asked you not to lie to me and yet that is exactly what you have done.”
“I said I still had stuff to tell you, just… you needed to give me time.”
“This isn’t the same as the stuff with the miscarriage, Levi. This isn’t something you can just hide from me and think I wouldn’t work out. Did you tell them all they couldn’t tell me?”
“No one really knew… not apart from Mike, because you told him.”
“And you think that makes it okay?”
“Fine, you want to know our first time? It wasn’t romantic, you weren’t gentle or kind; you bent me over in the wine cellar at your own father’s wake.” Levi’s hands bunched at his sides, and when he spoke, spittle rushed through the air between them. “It was messy as hell and you hated yourself for it, but you didn’t remember, so I just—”
“You lied.”
“Yeah. I’d do it again if it meant protecting you from the things that Mike wants to drag up.”
“Because he’s my friend?”
“Maybe, or maybe it’s just that he hates you settled for me. You traded in the hot wife, and the nice house and the great career for someone like me. It’s what everyone thought. It’s what your dad thought. You think I don’t know that?”
Erwin studied Levi, the red flush of his face, the wet smear of his swollen eyes. “I’m sorry. Am I supposed to be pitying you right now?”
“No.” Levi looked up at him, his chin tilted so high, his eyes fixed on him, and his lips so shiny with spit. The couple was watching them from across the courtyard now, smoking cigarettes and looking on with intrigue. “I don’t want you to pity me.”
“That’s good because I don’t.” Erwin nodded his head, tried to breathe through the aching panic, the part of him that wanted to throttle Levi for doing this to him, letting him get caught up in the lies he wove around them. “I’m just wondering when you became such a goddamn liar.”
“You’re not the man I married!” It came out in a flurry, so quick that Erwin had to replay the words and separate them until it made sense. Oh. “Erwin, I didn’t — I didn’t mean it like that, but you don’t remember anything and I just… if you don’t remember, then what’s the harm in rewriting it the way we wanted it to be? If it meant you hated yourself a little less.”
“You’re right.” He took a deep breath, tried to fight through the anger and the pain at Levi’s words. “If it was up to me, we wouldn’t be married either.”
“That’s not what I meant…” Levi’s voice was low again, confused almost as he blinked quietly. The squeak of the door opening behind them broke the contact between them and Erwin watched Levi turn, watched the way his hair bounced and settled with the quick movement as Mike stood in the doorway, Hange beside him, both their faces were uneasy, as if they had heard everything.
“Thankfully, everyone else is too drunk and too into Moblit’s godawful speech right now to hear the two of you, but you might want to stop,” Hange said quietly. Erwin nodded his head, fingers twitching over his hair to try to draw some composure.
“Mike, do you think I can stay at yours tonight?” Erwin said, loud and firm enough. Levi wouldn’t dare argue about this, not when so many of his recent failings had revealed themselves so clearly. He was the type to retreat and lick his wounds in private.
“Of course,” Mike said, his eyes caught on Erwin, though he could see them drifting down to Levi.
“Pieck’s feeling pretty tired and thinking of leaving,” Hange said, softer with their face pointed directly to Levi. “She’d be happy to give you a ride home.”
“Sure,” Levi said quietly, arms folded over his chest. Erwin could see where his fingers were biting down into the fabric beneath his arms. “Whatever.”
That night Erwin sat on the small double bed in the guest bedroom in Mike and Nana’s house. He sat with his old friend, he on the bed and Mike leaning against the wall opposite, a glass of whiskey in both their hands.
“I don’t hate you guys together, I don’t hate him. I never hated him,” Mike said, a little bit of guilt peeling into the edges of his words. “I wasn’t trying to break things up between you. No one else back home knew how you got together until you told me. Marie didn’t deserve that.”
“You were never all that accommodating to him. Even before,” Erwin said quietly, twirling the liquor around the bottom of the glass. It needed ice, really, but the burn suited his mood.
“I thought you were too accommodating — you were acting like a dad to Isabel when you were barely more than a kid yourself. I appreciate he needed support, but he shouldn’t have taken advantage like that.”
“He wasn’t taking advantage. He was a kid. We were friends. I enjoyed spending time with the two of them,” Erwin said, memories flickering through his mind; Isabel’s delirious giggle, Levi serving him cheap refills in the diner as Erwin studied for papers he was already well-prepared for. Walking them to the bus stop if he stayed until closing. “Did you know we were together back then?”
Erwin hadn’t told him back then — they’d kept it to themselves until he blabbed to his father, and then only Marie had known, Moblit too, although he never said a word.
“No, I didn’t know that.”
“Barely a few weeks and then I told my father, and he told me it would ruin the friendship and my future if we took things further, so I broke up with him. Broke his heart, and mine, I suppose.”
“You suppose?”
“I compartmentalised. Decided my father was right, and that it was wrong of me to continue down that path. Levi needed a support system that wouldn’t erode if we were to break up. I met Marie and we — the two of us — everyone said we were right for each other, so perhaps we just went along with it. I loved her. I still love her. The me that can’t remember the last four years, at least. I feel immense guilt for having cheated her as I did.”
Mike was silent. Erwin heard him sip the liquor, heard the gentle ting of his teeth catching on the rim of the glass. Eventually, he cleared his throat.
“You were in a bad place with your father dying. Levi was there for you. He understands you more than anyone. I wouldn’t ever dispute that.”
“Do you have a problem with me being with a man?”
Mike barked out a surprised laugh, enough so that Erwin looked over at him. He batted a hand in the air and shook his head. “Never, Erwin. I don’t give a fuck that Levi’s a man. Me and Levi, we were never best buddies. We got on, but last year he went through something terrible and you confided in me about the fostering situation and ever since the accident he’s just lied to you. Of course, I’m fucking pissed at him. You cheated on your wife with him. Left your life in California for him. You got married and didn’t tell anyone. You left the firm to take up a job as a teacher, yet you squirrel yourself away in your father’s shop. Did you know your dad left him money in his will? That’s how he could afford to buy the teashop.”
“Dad thought of him as a second son. He was always worried about Levi and Isabel.” The main precursor to encouraging Erwin to break up with Levi was that he didn’t want Levi ending up with no one and he’d known back then that Levi’s friendships had, at that point, channelled directly through Erwin.
“I know, I don’t dispute that, but I’m going to guess he didn’t tell you that.” Erwin shrugged, and Mike sighed along with him. “You know, buddy, you can stay here as long as you need to. We have the space.”
“Thank you. I may take you up on that.”
Erwin timed things as well as he could. He knew Levi left for a run every morning, that he would be back by seven-thirty and that he always arrived home in a far better mood than he awoke.
He wouldn’t be in a good mood.
There wasn’t a sense of clarity that Erwin had awoken with, but just a deeply settled grief that he knew needed fixing. He showed up at the empty house to wait it out, would grab some things to take with him and then wait for Levi, so they could discuss as rationally as possible.
Erwin packed a bag; just a small one. He filled it with t-shirts and sweaters, sweatpants, and enough jeans to see him through for the time being. He remembered buying the holdall at the airport after a vacation in Mexico, where they bought too many souvenirs. Him and Marie - the only marriage he remembered. It saw him through that marriage until now. He zipped it up and wheeled it into the kitchen before moving up the stairs again.
He packed his razor, his toothbrush, stared at the spotless sink that Levi cleaned to a gleaming polish every other day. He pulled open the drawer underneath where Levi’s Transformers lunchbox, emergency contraception, aspirin and bandaids were all neatly piled. He grabbed the aspirin, closing it with his knee.
He fingered the ring he wore around his neck on a chain. Thoughts of leaving it clouded his head, but that was too final and that wasn’t his intent. He wasn’t ending things, only stopping how they were continuing. It felt too much to still wear it, so he unclasped the necklace and let the ring slide from the chain. He stared at it, gold rather than silver, no engraving or promises, just a simple band. He kissed it, curled his fingers around it, and then placed it gently in his wallet.
Toiletries zipped away, he added them to a rucksack with his devices and stared at the bed. Levi had made it, pulled the bedspread taut, almost military style, the powder blue stretched over plump pillows, the throw at the end of the bed in soft white acrylic wool, folded neatly. It was likely that he hadn’t even slept in it last night.
Erwin had held his husband in this bed. Fallen asleep with him. Made love to him and cried with him. He’d never seen the point in any form of attachment to physical objects, but somehow, in this moment, he had some.
He moved down the stairs to see Levi standing in the kitchen in his running gear, staring down at the holdall Erwin had placed there. His hands folded into fists at his sides. When his eyes lifted to meet Erwin, his brow furrowed. He looked as if he’d gotten very little sleep.
“Isn’t this excessive?” Levi’s voice was thick, a little hoarse.
“It’s not forever.”
“I waited years for you, just for you to leave me again.” Levi laughed, a sad thing that caught in his chest. He looked away, so Erwin couldn’t see him.
Erwin’s own voice was soft as he spoke. “We can’t live like this, pretending that things are okay.”
“I only — if you couldn’t remember, I thought it was okay to only tell you the good bits, so you didn’t have to know. You live with so much shame, Erwin. Ever since I met you and I didn’t want you to be ashamed of us.”
“I’m not ashamed of you,” Erwin promised. “Not like that.”
Levi didn’t speak, though he turned back around. He sucked at his bottom lip, tucked his arms over his chest.
“I came to stay when your dad died because you were struggling, and we… After the wake, we continued and she must have found out. You guys had a dinner party with a bunch of your California dipshit friends and she announced what we’d done to everyone. She called me a whore. She said you were fucking a tranny. Which you were, but I didn’t… it wasn’t like that and she didn’t get to call me that, not even when we did what we did to her. You internalised it, blamed yourself, and I didn’t want you doing that. Not again. When I saw how hard it was accepting your dad had died again.”
“It isn’t just about that. You lied to me and I lied to you.” Erwin stepped closer to him. “And you were right. I’m not the man you married.” He cupped a hand to Levi’s cheek. His thumb resting beneath his eyelid, where the tears were holding for the time being. “I need time to remember myself. To find out who I am without fitting into the shape of this marriage.”
“What if you don’t want to come back?”
“I just need to focus on sorting myself out.”
“I can’t stop you,” Levi said. The thought of staying was tempting the longer he was with Levi. He could put his suitcase away and they’d have sex, good sex that felt damn amazing but then he’d lie, say he’d remembered something and Levi would sugarcoat something else and they’d fall into the cycle again and again and again.
“I’m going to stay with Mike for a bit. Work on myself. I want to be with you Levi, but the past versions of ourselves are gone. Even if the memories come back, it wouldn’t be the same.”
“I don’t care. Fuck, I don’t care. I love you and you feel the same, so don’t go. Please don’t go. We can get therapy or some shit. I’ll explain everything.”
Erwin moved in, pulling Levi close. He could feel nails biting into his spine, and the shaking of Levi’s body, from anger rather than tears. Levi had been trying to protect him, protect their relationship as messy as they had allowed it to become.
“Will you let me go?” He asked into Levi’s hair, the strands catching in his mouth.
“Fuck you, Erwin, fuck you.” Levi pulled his hands from Erwin’s back and squirmed so that he could free himself completely. His hands immediately curled over his face, as he breathed deep. His wedding ring sparkled in the overhead lighting, and Erwin’s chest ached along with him.
“You have to let me do this. There’s things I need to do alone before I can come back.”
“What things?”
Marie was the first thought in his mind. There had never been much passion but a long-grown ease and understanding of their relationship. He wasn’t cruel enough to mention her name; not after what Levi had said about her comments. He had, at this point, no reason to doubt Levi despite the previous lies. But he needed to talk to her, to find out what he had done and how it had ended.
“Just parts of myself that have been left open. That I cannot trust you to tell the truth with. I’m going to go and stay with Mike. I don’t think we should contact each other for a while.”
“I love you,” Levi said quietly. “If that means anything.”
“I love you too,” Erwin responded. He stepped closer and Levi shied away from him, as if his touch was something painful. Erwin held his small face in his hands, his damp cheeks caged between his thumbs. “You’re worth so much.”
“Get the fuck out of my house.”
As he stepped out of the house and opened his trunk, Isabel rounded the corner, padding up the driveway in battered old sneakers. She looked a state; her pink make up smeared, her shiny outfit from the night before now covered by an oversized hoodie. She smiled at him lazily, and then frowned when she saw the holdall.
“Erwin?” She said, her voice hoarse. She’d been on something heavier than the hard lemonade Levi had found in her backpack. “What’s going on?”
“I’m going away for a little while,” he mumbled, watching her mouth drop open. He went to her and hugged her close. She smelled pretty terrible, like he remembered smelling at her age; booze, sweat and weed. He rubbed her back for a moment before pulling back. “I need you to look after your dad for me, okay? Make sure he’s alright.”
Chapter 8
Memories
For Levi’s twenty-fifth birthday, Hange was throwing a surprise party. It didn’t sound like something Levi would want, but Hange had been talking of it for weeks, and it was being thrown at an empty gallery space downtown, somewhere Moblit had purchased, but with no real art installation in place. It would just be him tonight. Marie had refused to come.
“He doesn’t like me, Erwin,” she said, when he asked her to come before she left. “I’d only ruin it.”
“That’s just the way he comes across,” Erwin insisted, but she’d raised an eyebrow at him and he’d swallowed down the rest of the fight. They fought more these days, because he was never home and she wanted to start a family soon. Or talk about it at least. Erwin didn’t want to talk about it.
“I conspired with Zeke,” his father said, with a sparkle in his eye. Erwin was wearing a dark blue shirt and had parted his hair to the side. He’d shaved so carefully, he’d ended up nicking a cut into his jaw. It stood out like a red spot over his face. He ought not to be so vain, but he hadn’t seen Levi in over a year. He wanted to make a good impression.
“You like him, then?” Erwin said quietly in the kitchen. Through the window, he could see Isabel playing with the new scooter Levi had got her for Christmas; orange and glittery with pink tassels beneath the handlebars. His father had insisted to Levi that he wanted to have Isabel overnight, and Zeke had dropped her off earlier in the day.
“He’s fine enough. He treats Levi with respect and takes care of the two of them.”
“Right,” Erwin said. “That’s good.”
“Erwin, son. You will behave yourself tonight, won’t you?” Erwin understood the implications in the tone, but decided against engaging. He simply turned to his father and smiled wide.
“Always.”
“No Marie?” Mike asked, holding three stackable chairs as he passed, Moblit directing them to the far wall. They’d both shown up early to help Moblit and Hange help set up for the evening. Erwin was helping fill balloons with enough helium, they all floated to the ceiling in blues and pinks. Hange’s idea.
“No, she’s visiting college friends tonight.” It wasn’t a lie, she really was, but she wouldn’t have arranged it so quickly after finding out about the party. Erwin was convinced Levi would blow up massively about the party. He hated drawing attention to himself, hated large parties, and found open displays of affection discomforting.
Still, he hid behind the banner Hange had made when they heard footsteps approaching from outside. Levi looked close to committing mass murder when the lights turned on as they stepped into the gallery. He tucked his hands over his chest and glared, even as Zeke threw an arm over his shoulder, bending down to whisper something into his ear.
“You don’t turn twenty-five every day,” Hange said, thrusting a glass of Moblit’s eggnog into his hand.
“I didn’t turn twenty-five today,” Levi said, stepping back, frowning when the alcohol spilled over his knuckles.
“Don’t be so pissy,” they shrugged, elbowing Levi’s shoulder. “Anyway, not my fault you were born on Christmas Day and we couldn’t celebrate then. Now is good enough.”
“Alright, four-eyes.” Levi looked down and away, anger dissipating into a general awkwardness. “But do this again and I’ll kill you.”
Erwin milled around the party, engaging with older friends and trying to stop himself from seeking out Levi. Seeking out Levi was a bad idea, when he was drunk and alone, when Levi was wearing a shirt so tight he’d been able to see the points of his nipples through it.
It didn’t work. Levi found him not an hour later, eyes glassy with booze. His face was so pretty. Erwin’s heart flipped at the sight of him. He swallowed the dregs of his beer to distract himself from those thoughts, ran through his usual variants on small talk as Levi stared up at him.
“Twenty-five, wow,” Erwin said, which was maybe the worst variant to land on. He grimaced, saw the way Levi’s mouth twitched, just slightly at the comment.
“Where’s the wife?”
“Out with friends,” Erwin said, looking at him. He had a leather jacket on now that was too large and covered his knuckles. Zeke had been wearing it earlier, but Levi always ran cold. It suited him; leather suited him, although even Erwin wasn’t tipsy enough to tell him. With the jacket falling as it did, it hid his nipples, so Erwin wasn’t so distracted.
“You ever coming home?” Levi asked, “your dad keeps asking as if I’d know.”
“I don’t know.” He didn’t. He was going places in the firm he worked for. They all wanted him on the more complex cases, as inexperienced as he was. He was good with them, good with the clients, and talking his way out of trouble.
“I’ll let him know.” Levi’s eyes darted around the place, the music loud and the string of people that Erwin was fairly sure Levi didn’t actually know. He didn’t know most of them either, so they must be work associates of Hange. “You’ve cut yourself, you know?”
“Pardon?”
“Here.” Levi reached out, one of his icy fingers brushing Erwin’s jaw, where the blade had nicked his skin. “Dumbass. How old are you that you can’t even shave correctly?”
“I could hardly show up to your birthday surprise with even a bare amount of stubble.” Levi’s thumb circled his skin, the slight jag of his nail digging into his jaw.
“Why’s that?” Levi’s hand was still on his jaw, he realised at perhaps the same time Levi did, who thrust his hand down and away.
“Just wouldn’t be right.” His face was pink, his eyes downcast, suddenly sober.
“Thanks for coming, I guess,” Levi said. “Excuse me, I’m gonna get wasted on beer someone else has paid for.”
Erwin floated around for a while, never getting drunk enough to hide the weirdness of the night. He could still feel Levi’s cool fingers on his skin, how they had rested there for longer than they ought to, for longer than either of them had realised.
“Erwin, can I have a word?” Erwin turned to the sound of Mike, who had drifted in from outside, cigarette smoke still clinging to him. He was perspiring at his hairline, damp sweat running down the length of his nose.
“Everything okay?”
“Yeah, I just wanted your advice.” Mike waited for Erwin to nod before he looked around, fishing in his pocket. He pulled out a black velvet box. “I purchased this last week.”
“Not for me, I hope.”
Mike barked out a laugh. “No, not for you. Nana. I wanna marry her so badly, Erwin. Fucking love her to pieces.”
“You thinking of doing it tonight?”
“Here? No, I just wanted to see what you thought. You’re my only married buddy. You like it, don’t you?”
Erwin did like the comfort that came with marriage. The safety net of knowing Marie was always there for him. He wasn’t sure either of them have ever looked at each other in the way Mike and Nana looked at each other.
“Yes, I like it. I think you and Nana are perfectly suited to one another.”
Mike smiled widely, his cheeks pink. “Yeah, yeah. I think so too.”
Erwin drank heavier on the news of Mike’s impending engagement. They celebrated with shots until the world blurred. There was a quiet office built into the gallery that was being used as a makeshift cloakroom. Erwin thought he’d like to take a nap there, to sober up. Neither his dad nor Marie would be impressed at him coming home in the state he was currently in.
He rested his hand on the door when he heard voices. Two voices, one far more familiar than the other.
“Mmm, tell me more,” Levi’s voice was thick with arousal. Erwin hadn’t heard him like that before. He hovered, knew he shouldn’t, but at this point was drunk enough that all he wanted to do was rest his ear to the wall and listen in, just for a little bit. If he couldn’t go in to sleep.
“I’ll tie you to the bed.”
“No, you fucking won’t,” Levi growled, though the anger was softened by the lack of sobriety. Zeke must have done something because Levi let out a breathless laugh that stretched out onto a moan.
“Okay, but you’ll have to behave yourself,” Zeke said instead, sounding a little annoyed for a second. “You’ll stretch out on the bed and if you’re good, I’ll put that suction toy on your little T-dick. You’ll like that, won’t you? It gets you wetter than shot day.”
“Mmm.” Erwin backed away, embarrassed by the intimacy he’d heard. Levi having sex, Levi who had flinched when Erwin had touched him in particular places, and Levi who had phoned him almost hysterical the first time he’d had sex with Zeke.
On his panicked flee from the office, he stumbled first over his own feet and then into the first person he saw as he rounded the office. Thankfully, it was only Hange, who looked surprisingly sober for the night.
“Hange,” he said, when he saw them, or two of them. They held their hands out, and he grabbed hold of them. He pulled them in close. “You ever feel like you fucked up your life?”
“Not really,” Hange said, but their voice was softer than he remembered it ever being, and they were hugging him back like a normal person. “You wanna crash at ours tonight?”
“Yeah. Might be a good idea.”
++++
Mike and Nana gave Erwin plenty of space in the following days. He sensed Mike’s guilt for his behaviour at the gallery, or maybe Nana’s fury got to him. She’d been mad in the aftermath. Erwin had heard the arguments and he’d seen his feet dangling from the end of the couch when he’d passed the living room for a glass of water late at night.
He spent most of the nights in the guest bedroom, playing through what had happened. Levi’s lies and his insistence that they were from protection, his fierce and broken anger when he realised Erwin was leaving, if only for the time being.
It felt odd falling asleep without Levi’s nose tucked between his shoulder-blades or curled up against his chest. When he awoke in the morning, it wasn’t to Levi’s gentle kisses over his eyelids, trying to cajole him into the shower as he left for his morning run.
He went to work and Armin, thankfully, was none the wiser about anything. He chatted to fill the blanks in the day, excitable with knowledge in a way Erwin vaguely remembered being like when he was far younger.
“Levi didn’t know it,” Erwin said, when Armin asked if he’d found out his password. The kid had been shooting nervous looks at Erwin every so often, as if he realised something wasn’t quite right the more time they spent together, but he never divulged.
“It must be hard… everything,” Armin shrugged, hands shoved down into his pockets, cheeks a little pink. He was embarrassed, for Erwin or himself, he wasn’t sure.
“He always scared me a little bit,” Armin said, leaning against the counter during a lull. He was warming his hands around a mug of coffee from Erwin’s coffeemaker in the corner and his eyes were down on the floor. “He’s so small, but he’s fierce. Has he always been like that?”
“He hasn’t changed much,” Erwin said, counting all the ways he had, even as he tried not to. “He is mostly bark. Perhaps not so much previously. You’re not that different in age to his daughter. He cares about you.”
Armin’s brow furrowed. “Yeah?”
“In his way.”
“Right.” Armin shrugged his shoulder, drank his coffee and floated back to behind the counter when the bell dinged over the door.
That night, he laid in bed wide awake. Guilt and remorse and Levi’s face as it had been all those years back when he’d left him in that tiny little apartment, hiding his hurt behind the screen by his bed. Then older, hunched over in the chair when Erwin had woken from his coma. Their comings together, and their comings apart.
His phone vibrated on the nightstand, jolting him from his reverie. He leaned over and picked it up, saw Isabel’s name pop up with one new message.
Five.18.19
He stared at the numbers for a while, before he couldn’t cope any longer. He dialled, and she picked up on the third ring.
“‘Sup?”
“Isabel, hi. It’s Erwin.”
“I know. I have caller ID.” She was blunt with him, angry with him. Erwin understood why, but he only recalled her ever being sweet to him, in recent weeks nothing beyond a gentle tease.
“Yes, of course. How’s your dad doing?”
“He’s okay.” Isabel sounded cautious, which was a little unnerving. Isabel was never cautious, not about anything. “I moved back in for a bit because he hasn’t been alone, like, ever. He needs someone to look after. So he can fuss around them. Stops him thinking, I guess.”
“I’m sorry,” he murmured, but she just tutted at him, a small groan caught in the back of his throat.
“No, you’re not. You always do this. You always make him think you care and then you leave.” She sounded furious of a sudden, in a way he hadn’t heard before.
“Of course I care, but Isabel, there’s a lot you don’t know.”
“Maybe, but there’s a lot I remember too.” She didn’t expand. He didn’t need her to. “It’s whatever. He’s been through worse. I just wanted to let you know that was your password for your laptop. When dad used to ground me, sometimes I’d go to your shop and use your computer to do homework.”
“Thank you.” This was the most uncomfortable he had ever felt with her. He remembered clear as day, Isabel sitting across from him in the diner, her tiny little baby teeth crooked, red hair hanging in messy clumps, no matter how much Levi tried to neaten it with ribbons.
“You know what the password means?” She asked and then lowered her voice. In the background, he could hear Levi grunting out Isabel’s name.
“Our wedding date, I imagine,” Erwin said, thinking about the time, over two years ago now.
“Bingo, you piece of shit.”
Erwin was visiting Hange, helping them scrub potatoes in the kitchen after they’d been freshly pulled from the earth. Hange was into gardening these days, as domesticated as they would ever be. He was there, in part, to make up for the scene he had caused during Moblit’s opening night. And also for dinner, as they had invited him.
“I suppose there are things we shouldn’t talk about,” Hange said, using a knife to peel off the sprouted edges of the potato. They were bent over the sink, overalls sliding down their shoulders with the vigorous movements. “There are things I didn’t know.”
“Like what?”
“You and Levi’s scandalous affair, for one.”
“I’m not sure if it was scandalous.”
“Hmm.” Hange didn’t sound convinced. “Not like you’d remember, I guess.”
“A little low, Hange.”
“Sounds like you deserve it,” they reasoned. It was fair. Erwin didn’t have it in him to argue beyond that.
“I moved out. I thought maybe distance would help, but I spoke to Isabel on the phone and I think the two of them hate me.”
“I think Moblit is the introspective one between me and him,” Hange said softly. They dropped both the knife and potato and turned to look at Erwin instead. “You would never be the man your father wanted you to be. The suits didn’t fit. Well, you looked good, don’t get me wrong.”
“Thanks Hange,”
“Don’t interrupt. I’m just saying, you spent all that time running away from what you wanted to be. From who you wanted. I don’t know what went down between you and Marie, but it was shitty of Mike to lay all that blame on Levi, doncha think?”
“He is very protective. I’m not sure why.”
“Because he cares for you and you sometimes make idiotic mistakes, but he never liked Levi much, so he was just as biased in forcing a confession as Levi was in lying to you.”
“I don’t know what to do, or where to go from here,” Erwin admitted, curling his hands around his glass.
“We’ll work something out,” Hange said , pushing their glasses back up the length of their nose.
Dinner was a pot pie with mashed potatoes, and by the time it was in the oven, both Moblit and Pieck had arrived home. Moblit’s expression was welcoming, if a little pitiful, Pieck’s was less so. She left to change out of her floral scrubs and he didn’t see her until much later, hair damp tied up, in sweatpants that probably belonged to Hange.
Hange was more than happy to talk over everyone as they all ate, perhaps conspiring with Moblit to fill the gaps, or maybe that was just Hange being themselves. Still, the food was palatable if not particularly tasty and Hange whipped the empty plates away in no time, ordering Moblit to help.
“Have you seen him? Is he okay?” Erwin asked, watching Pieck drink from a large glass of red wine once they were alone. She stared at him with her dark, tired eyes.
“You’re not an idiot, Erwin, so I don’t know why you ask me that when you know what the answer is.” He looked down, ashamed, when the words came at him pointed and clear. “He’s certainly not wallowing in self-pity, though. I’m relatively new in his life, but he has told me a lot.”
“So you know what we did?”
“Yes.”
“You knew he hadn’t told me the truth?”
“Of course, but he’s hardly the only one to ever deny the truth, is he now?” She sipped her wine, looking the other way. “I’ve had a long day on the ward, and I’m going to bed, but I would think about fixing things while you still can. He might not wait around forever.”
By the time Hange and Moblit came back into the room and Erwin had told them what Pieck had said, they both laughed.
“You see why they’re friends? Total drama queens,” Hange said. “So gloomy.”
“She has a point,” Moblit said, and Hange nodded their head.
“For sure, fix things while you still can and if not, I’ll throw your divorce party while Pieck organises Levi’s. Sound good?”
Hange saw Erwin out to his car that night. It had been a night of both good, friendly support and a reality check. Erwin felt sore and well-loved, and was trying to string his usual platitudes together when Hange forced a scrap of paper into his hand.
“Moblit’s big on Christmas cards. You meet him once, you get a card and an annual update on our life. I went wandering into his Filofax and would ya look at that? I found your ex-wife’s contact details. You wanna make amends? Maybe start there.”
“Hange,” Erwin started, but found he didn’t have the words. It didn’t matter. They were clapping him on the back and pulling him into a hug.
“Sort things out, Erwin, even if for my sake. Pieck’s not happy I had you around tonight. She’s moved into the guest bedroom again.”
“I’ll try,” he said, laughing. “For your sake, if not mine.”
Erwin half expected the moment he logged onto his laptop, the rest of his life would come flooding back. He’d see the desktop wallpaper - no doubt a photo of his new family - and remember exactly when it was taken and how he felt, and the taste of Levi’s lips on that day.
Reality turned out to be a little different. The first time he logged in, the computer had an hour’s worth of updates it wanted to install, so he wandered off, brought some groceries and worked the till, covering Armin’s lunch.
By the time the kid was back, relieving Erwin of his duty, he hurried back to his office. The screen was blank, and he tapped the touchpad, lighting it up. Levi was in his background, off-centre, more invested in the landscape, the waterfalls. Where they were, Erwin couldn’t be sure, and grief caught him in the chest; painful swallows that had him clearing his throat. Why he thought he would remember, he didn’t know.
He opened his emails, cringed at how full his inbox was. It looked a mix between personal and work. He scrolled for ages, until he got to the last opened one, six weeks back now.
It was just his contract - signed and dated - for the career in academia he had finally allowed himself to fall into. Curiosity got the better of him; he closed the emails down and opened his most recent files. All of them research. It had been his favourite thing about college, collating articles and papers, poking around until he could argue his own case, his own point of view.
He’d written a lot. He could see that from the index page he’d created. For the last couple of years, he’d focused on getting his articles in to national journals, even a few obscure international pieces. Levi had told him that much. He hadn’t lied about that.
By the time Armin popped his head in before closing, Erwin had his head clutched in his own hands, that dull ache teasing at his temples again. It rarely went away these days.
“Oh, you logged-in,” Armin said, pointing his finger toward the laptop squared to Erwin’s desk.
“Not that it has done me much good. I had hoped to find personal stuff on here, but it’s mostly work related. And there're more emails here than I can ever think to sort through.” Truthfully, Erwin had thought little about it. He had plans for the next few days and had hoped to have been done with all this by that point.
The night before, he had purchased a return flight to California, booked himself a few nights in a hotel and not imagined anything beyond that.
“I’m heading to California tomorrow. I thought perhaps I’d have access to my personal photographs, but I guess not.”
“Well. It’s quiet here in the day, isn’t it? If you want, I can help sort out your emails, put them into folders for you. I think you’re probably just not logged into the cloud. I can sort it for you.”
“You’re sure?”
“Yeah,” Armin nodded his head. His mouth opened and closed again a few times before he continued. “I know you lived in Cali with your ex-wife, so I’m guessing you’re seeing her?”
“She agreed to see me.” She had last night, an hour before Erwin had booked his flight out, though he could tell by the shortness of her messages she hadn’t been pleased to hear from him.
“I also know you’re not staying with Levi.” Before Erwin could argue, Armin smiled, just a little. “Your shirts are all creased. Levi wouldn’t let you out the house like that otherwise.”
“We’ve been sort of—” he trailed off, felt ashamed that he hadn’t been able to speak of this to Armin. “Going through a process.”
“That’s okay.” Armin was turning red beneath his mop of blond hair, about as comfortable with the conversation as Erwin had been. “I’ll see if I can get back into your old accounts with your photos.”
“Thank you, Armin.”
“Yeah Erwin, you are different now to know you were before. I suppose you’ve lost a lot… and it’s all a grieving process.”
“I lost my father all over again.”
“I meant for yourself. What you’ve lost,” Armin said, but then he was ducking his head, apologising as if he’d said something wrong. Erwin stared at him in thought, but didn’t force the issue.
Erwin packed one small bag and told Mike and Nana over dinner that night of his plans to spend a couple of days in California, visiting his ex-wife, who he ruined in so many terrible ways.
“That’s what you want? To go back to California?” Mike asked. He seemed apologetic. Nana had only just started to talk with him as she had prior to the night at Moblit’s gallery opening.
“I don’t want to, but I need answers from Marie. I need to go back to what I remember to find out how I lost it. Own up to what I did to her.”
“That doesn’t sound like a bad idea,” Nana said, looking at him with her fierce blue eyes. “You okay with what she might say to you? It might not be positive.”
“I’m aware. I know I need to face up to it. What I — what Levi and I did to her.”
“Do you need a ride to the airport?” Mike asked, and Erwin nodded, thanking him without words.
It was funny, he thought, how he awoke a few weeks back and did nothing but miss California; whether it was the sun in the Golden State, the people, or the vibe of the city. Now he was fumbling his way into the back of an Uber, staring down at his sneakers. He wore sneakers to run in when he was in California, but he wore smart shoes that pinched his toes the rest of the time. Since he’d been back home, he’d lived in these old sneakers; soft and well-worn.
The hotel was only a twenty-minute drive to Marie’s house. He was relieved that she’d sold their place together. He’d struggle to see it again. His mind still thought of it as his house, not the one he lived in with Levi. He still imagined their lazy Sunday mornings together, brunch on Saturdays, pouring the good coffee into his thermos and kissing her cheek goodbye in their South-facing kitchen every morning.
He showered and brushed his teeth to clean away the flight. He shaved and stared at himself in the mirror. He knew he was handsome, in that traditional sense, knew it in how only a smile in the right direction would send people to flush, to swallow nervously. Even Levi, as stoic and unchangeable as he was, fell for his charms. Marie had fallen for it once, and he’d hurt her.
He re-dressed, checked the time it would take to get to Marie’s house, and opened a message from Armin. He’d finally given the necklace to his friend, and it sat pretty against her throat. On her head was a birthday tiara, though she didn’t look happy about it. There was a taller boy with eyes just as green as Isabel, his hair swept off his face in a bun and his arm around her. Armin was sitting lower, a little blurred from where he was trying to take the photo. They were not dissimilar in age to when he met Levi. It made his heart burn, and he rubbed at his chest. It was strange not bumping into the chain around his neck.
Erwin knew from an intense catch-up-on-what-you’ve missed from Hange that Marie had moved house, somewhere further out of the city closer to better schools. She had two children under two, and was married to Nile Dok. A man Erwin had been borderline aquatinted with; a freshly divorced neighbour when Erwin and Marie had moved in a few rows down.
He couldn’t help but feel nauseas when he stood in front of her door, the meticulously manicured lawn, the sweet honeysuckle plants hanging from pots level with his head. When the door opened, he was shocked. What he remembered of Marie was her professional Brazilian blow-out, her dark, bouncy hair that fell to her mid-back. Her tanned skin. Her professional pencil skirts and blouses.
Her hair now was shorter, sitting in a scruffy ponytail at her crown. She was in a Breton top and leggings. Two children in such a short amount of time had thickened her waist and chest. Her jaw looked a little fuller. Her smile was fake, but the waves of content happiness radiated around.
“Erwin.” He thought of holding his hand out to shake, but that wasn’t quite right. “Come in.”
Erwin followed his ex-wife through her house. It was littered with bright colourful toys, stuffed teddies sitting on the couch. They ended up in the kitchen, and he stared down at the table he remembered buying to fill the space in their condo. It was sticky with syrup when he placed his hand atop it, and scuffed on the edge where a highchair brushed too close.
“I heard about the accident,” Marie said, distracting his thoughts. He looked over at her and nodded, hands slipping behind his back, clutching at his own fingers.
“The car was in worse shape. I’m not sure how much you’re aware of.”
“You’ve got amnesia. Lost some memories.” She looked sheepish for a moment. She had been close with Nana out of all of them; two outsiders to their pack.
Still, he conceded with a nod, and graciously took the mug of coffee, poured fresh from the pot. He took a seat at his old table; the chairs didn’t match, and were padded with floral cushions, making him feel lopsided.
“It’s like I went to work one morning, kissed you goodbye like I used to. Then I woke up in a hospital bed in a whole other life.”
“The life you always wanted, though, right?” She closed her eyes and nodded, receptive though he could see the pain. She twirled a finger through one of the wispy strands of hair by her face, and he realised the pain still stung.
“Marie.”
“I love my husband, and I love my two amazing daughters, but it’s never not going to hurt. The thing you did. With him. I convinced myself to trust the two of you when I knew how he felt about you. You decided to come here with me. To love me, but we never… we never loved each other properly, I don’t think. Not in the ways we were supposed to. We looked good together, our careers aligned, but I always wanted more and you seemed to want less.”
“I denied him for years.”
“Not enough. Not when he looked at you the way we all knew he looked at you. The way you always slipped to his side, or answered his calls. Or made his daughter a part of our fucking wedding. You think that either of us enjoyed that?”
“You never said.”
“It was the only thing you asked for,” she said, with eyes wet and welling. She sniffed. “Fuck. I told myself I wouldn’t cry. I’m still so angry.”
“You have every right to be.” Erwin felt anger at himself, at Levi, for doing this to her. “Levi said you found out, but I’m afraid I don’t have any memories of what exactly we did.”
They sat in quiet for a time, though Erwin could see how Marie was trying desperately to calm herself. He just waited, head tucked down.
“I don’t know for how long or how often, but you were a mess after your father died. Like every part of you that held everything together, suddenly gave way, and I asked him to come. You always said no one calmed you down like he did. Well, he certainly had his way.”
“I’m so sorry.”
“Yeah, you should be. I know what you look like when you’ve spent the day fucking. It used to be me. He was staying at a hotel close by. You came back, and I just knew. Knew what the two of you had been doing. Knew something had happened at the wake as well and I — we had a dinner party arranged when he was in town. I invited him, for your sake, because I knew you hated those parties and I wanted you to be happy because you were slipping deep into a depression I hadn’t seen before. I was angry at him more than you. Apparently, that’s not the way it should be.”
“He said you outed him.”
“I said nothing that people wouldn’t have suspected about him.” Her voice faded with the guilt of her words. “I know it’s wrong to hate him more than you, but I wanted to hurt him. To humiliate him like he did me. It was cheap, but I needed to feel something beyond the mortification.”
Erwin nodded his head, though he hated himself for it. Hated that he’d spent years building a life with Marie just to throw it away, was angry at Levi for participating in it with him, and loathed Marie for the vindictiveness she was still sending Levi’s way.
“Why are you here, Erwin?” Erwin sucked in a breath, looked at the woman he had committed to and hurt.
“I keep looking for answers.”
“What’s the question?”
“I’m feeling a little hazy about that. Everything has got so complicated,” he started and then stopped. It wasn’t fair of him to bring his new marital issues into his old marriage. “I get the impression I’ve changed a lot since our time together.”
She eyed him across the kitchen and then smiled into her coffee, the only genuine smile she had given him all day.
“You look tired,” she said, “Softer. In a good way. Levi… he was always good at loosening your strings.”
“I don’t want to drag up the past,” he said, even less so when she had only just smiled at him. Now her lips fell down-turned again and her knuckles paled against the sides of her mug. “There are a lot of blanks. You um. You kicked me out, I imagine.”
“Yes. The same night. Everyone left the party after I announced it. You didn’t fight me. Didn’t ask for a second chance, just left with the clothes on your back. You didn’t even pretend to fight.”
Erwin’s fingers twitched, and his skin burned with anger at his own cowardice. He wanted to say something, but nothing but flimsy apologies came to mind, and she’d hate that. He knew it.
“It was like you’d been waiting for me to make the decision for you. Everyone always said we were good together, looked good together,” she said. “But I wanted children and a family and you were so fixed on just throwing yourself into work. It didn’t occur to me for a long time that perhaps work was just a way for you to hide from your problems.”
It wasn’t just Levi. It was everything. Not practicing, not joining the family firm, letting down everyone, but she didn’t need to know that. She probably did, in her own way.
“I don’t want to burden you with the ins and outs,” Erwin said. It was over and it was done with, and beyond the residual anger he’d brought to the surface, she looked at peace. “You look happy. Congratulations on the children.”
She listed their names to him, but didn’t show any photos. The memories of the stilted arguments they’d had about kids sitting between them. He would never be proud of what he did to her, or how he stalled her own dreams as he hid from his own.
“So you married Nile?”
She nodded and softened at the sound of his name. That was good. Erwin was happy for her. “After we broke up, he was there for me. He’s not handsome like you are, maybe not as charming, but I love him and he makes me happy. Makes me laugh in ways you never did.”
Erwin was pleased, beneath the ache in his chest, at least. He drained his coffee, and yes, part of him wanted to cry. The grieving process had begun long before he’d shown up. But he was ready to let go now. Marie had made it out the other side, but the anger was still clinging to the corners, rearing its head every so often and there was little point staying for round two.
She saw him off a half hour later. They didn’t hug, and he didn’t kiss her cheek, either. Her daughters were at playdate, she’d said, and she needed him to leave so that she could go pick them up.
“We don’t talk anymore, Erwin, but we have mutual friends and I see photos of you online and think how happy you look. You made your bed, and we’re both happy that you’re lying in it. I don’t want to see you again, and I mean that in both the best and worst way. Go back home.”
He nodded his head, but he had one last thing that he wished to ask her. “Do you regret our time together?”
She paused for a moment and that hurt, made him feel inadequate, but he supposed he deserved that too. “Not all of it, but the length. We shouldn’t have let it go on for so long. We had some good times.”
There was little point in staying in San Francisco after that. It had always been an escape route rather than a home. Marie had grown up here and wanted to come back. He’d done it for her, and he’d ruined her in the process. He was at peace, at least with the fact that she seemed happy. Nile had given her the things he hadn’t; she adored her two beautiful children. He hadn’t totally ruined her life.
He had barely been back two days before Hange was forcing both him, Armin, and his laptop into the back of their wagon not long after closing. Armin gripped the laptop nervously and looked at Erwin for answers.
“What’s this about Hange?” He asked. Admittedly, the one night stop in California had been sobering enough that he’d felt a little shocked to be back home. Self-loathing had kept him up at night, and ignoring Hange’s near-constant texts had only added to his insomnia.
“Getting your life back on track, my friend. Mob came to the store while you were away. You know how he likes to check in and see if you’ve got anything worth grabbing for an auction. Wait... did you know that?”
They shot through a red light, and Erwin closed his eyes, brushed his hand through his hair. “I don’t recall…”
“And he saw Armin with the computer. He hacked your cloud, by the way.”
“I didn’t hack.” Armin’s voice hitched upwards. “You have a word document with all your passwords. Unlocked.”
“Moblit will explain it better,” Hange insisted, foot down as they jolted through a light, half a second from turning red.
After parking haphazardly in the driveway, they were led through the winding sprawl of Hange’s house to Moblit’s studio. Moblit was talking to Pieck when the three of them entered, the conversation ending abruptly.
“The three musketeers,” Pieck said softly, turning their cheek to Hange’s mouth when they pressed a squelching kiss to it. Moblit got the same treatment.
“Armin explained to me how you thought accessing all your personal photos might help you fill in the blanks, and I thought this might help. The four of us know you pretty well in different ways.”
Moblit stepped over to the furthest wall. There was a wide strip of blank paper taped and running the length of the far side. Five yards of it, perhaps.
“Say cheese!” Erwin looked up to see Hange wielding a Polaroid camera from the side, pointing it at where Armin and Erwin were standing, almost huddled. The camera spat out the photo and Hange shook it in their hand for a few seconds before handing it to Moblit.
Moblit taped it to the furthest end of the paper. Erwin stepped closer until he came into view with the fresh photo. Both he and Armin looked wide-eyed and pasty in the photo.
“I thought we could create you a timeline. Working backwards from this photo, to fill in what you don’t remember,” Moblit said. “All the memories we have of you from photos Armin finds; memorable parts that we all know make you the Erwin we know and love.”
“I explained to Levi. He’s happy for me to talk about the parts I know of you too,” Pieck said gently from beside him. “In time, I’m sure he’d take part.”
“Please, you guys don’t have to do this,” Erwin said, turning to the four of them.
“It’s a project, an assignment,” Moblit said, with a warm smile and his crinkling eyes. “Think of it like that.”
“Or an experiment,” Hange added, smiling softly. “It’s a way for you to find your way back to yourself, and others, if that’s what you’d like.”
Armin hadn’t just found Erwin’s password for the cloud, but had also created order to his emails. He hadn’t opened any of them for privacy reasons but had filed them into bills, general spam, personal, and work. Erwin poured through his folders, and it made it so much more manageable. He contacted suppliers for the antique store, and he contacted the university, who appeared relieved to hear from him. After some thought, he arranged a meeting with one of his attorneys to draw up papers, hoping to get some significant changes in place in other areas of his life.
He spent a lot of time studying his articles that he’d posted in journals, his reviews, reading up on the notes he found for his interview. It brought him in contact with his former self, and lit excitement in his stomach at being able to share his learnings in a lecture-hall sometime soon.
Erwin contacted Levi on a lonely night in Mike’s guest bedroom. Just asking to meet up to talk a little, to see where they were with each other. Levi didn’t reply until the early hours, but he did reply, and Erwin took that as a win. They arranged for the following afternoon. It was better, Erwin thought, to get it all out of the way.
They met in a cafe halfway between their two stores. Levi looked derisively at his tea (made with a bag) while Erwin was unsure whether to point out the fact that he could see Furlan tucked into a booth behind him, trying to hide behind the stack of menus.
Levi looked beautiful, some of his hair tucked behind his ear, the rest falling forwards. His hands were stacked neatly on the table and his dark eyes followed Erwin every time he shifted.
“Ignore him,” Levi said when Erwin’s eyes drifted over to Furlan, sitting as he was, to the left of Levi, trying to listen in, and working really hard to look like he wasn’t. “I didn’t ask him here. I don’t need a kid defending me to my own husband.”
“Why is he here?”
“’Cause Izzy would’a asked him,” Levi shrugged. “Anyway, why did you call me here?”
“So we could talk. I went to California, visited Marie.” Levi froze slightly and Erwin tried to come up with excuses before he realised he didn’t need them. “I just needed closure. She explained to me what happened between the two of us.”
Levi snorted, bitter. The words Marie had spat at Levi in the heat of the moment had tarnished her forever. Levi had always been relatively polite towards her, or as polite as Levi got. How he had bitten his tongue when lying to Erwin, he didn’t know.
“She doesn’t know the half of it.”
“Then explain. I need you to tell me because I’m not going to remember.”
“It was like you’d spent your life constipated, taking load after load of everyone’s expectations up your ass and when your dad kicked it, I guess maybe you took one enormous shit and let it all out.”
Erwin grimaced, saw the horrified expression on a passing waiter’s face. “That’s a little too visual, Levi.”
Levi shrugged. “Probably relief or whatever. Suddenly you realised you didn’t have to please everyone, or anyone. No expectations placed upon you and so you just… so we just. I didn’t want our first time to be like that. To be filthy like that. You fucking crying before you even pulled out. It was over in minutes. I had your come dripping down the insides of my thighs, cleaning up after your shitty relatives while you stood with your wife. So I just retold it like we both wanted it to be. Like it was once we got together.”
The visual was distressing enough, and Erwin wasn’t sure whether to be more angry at himself or Levi, whether the fact it was his beloved father’s funeral was enough of an excuse for that behaviour.
“Marie said she kicked me out the night she told everyone. Did we… is that when we got together?”
Levi looked at him with his nose scrunched up, red spots on his cheeks. He’d perhaps never seen him quite so offended.
“What kind of doormat do you think I am? I wasn’t some shitty consolation prize. I wasn’t gonna take you in because your wife kicked you out.”
“No, of course not.”
Levi tapped his fingers against the edge of the table, one of the few nervous ticks he had. His lashes lowered, and his mouth opened a few times.
“Your hands were always like fire to me, Erwin. Every time you touched me, it burned, and that’s hard to resist. But I had Izzy to think of, so I went home. Back to my house. The house we live in now. Your dad left me money and I could have blown up about the fact it was pity money for the shit he put me through, but I approached the owners of the coffee shop I worked in. I knew they were thinking of selling up. I gave them the number, they accepted, and I waited.”
“For long?”
“Not really. You stayed on my couch. We were friends like we used to be all those years back. Only my brat was a fucking sixteen-year-old and you’d given up the life that you’d wasted years building.”
“Then we got together?”
“Hold your horses, shithead.” Levi gave him a filthy stare and then shifted one hand into the inside of his jacket, pulling out a blue envelope. He held it in his hands before dropping it on the table.
“What’s that?” It felt familiar, though Erwin couldn’t quite work out how. It wasn’t just his own familiar scrawl of Levi’s name across the envelope he recognised.
“I was stressin’ and panicking because I had a business now and a kid that wouldn’t stay in school longer than three days at a time and you wrote me a fuckin’ letter. Put it in my bag so I’d find it when I was at work. It’s really pathetic, what you wrote, but it was from the heart.”
“What did it say?”
“You wrote it. Read it yourself, but not in front of me. I don’t—” Levi’s forehead creased, barely, but Erwin saw it, saw how his shoulders rose, resting to the height of his ears. “My feelings haven’t changed. Not since the day I turned eighteen, and you brought me a fuckin’ binder and made me feel special. I pursued you because I knew you felt the same, but you were always too chicken-shit to do anything. I’m not putting myself out there again. Not like that. You’ve got to come to me.”
“I want to,” Erwin said, reaching his hand out and gripping Levi’s. He could see by the way Levi flinched just a little that he didn’t quite believe him. “I want to come back to you and I will. I just need to work on myself.”
“Yeah alright.” Levi was gentle, though he still pulled his hands away. Erwin let him. “I heard about your art project. Figured you could use the help. Maybe that letter will be a good place. Izzy doesn’t want to talk to you right now, but she has a lot of photos. She even labelled them all. I’ll give them the Pieck. She’ll give them to you for your project.”
Levi stood up, tea barely touched, eyes skating around the floor, not quite meeting Erwin.
“Levi—“
“It’s whatever.” Levi looked down, where Erwin’s hand wrapped around his wrist. He stroked his thumb softly over the bump to the side of his wrist. “You know where I am when you’re ready.”
Erwin barely saw Mike and Nana. They’d asked about his time in California, but that he had arrived home a day early, more or less suggested how well it had gone. Sometimes they’d meet in the kitchen for coffee, but he was preoccupied by emailing manically with the college, signing paperwork that would see him starting the next semester, and didn’t have time for them otherwise. It excited him, and while the excitement felt familiar, it wasn’t quite from memory.
He wished he could remember how he found out about the original job; Levi would have kissed his mouth and said something vile with a compliment tucked inside. Maybe they went out to dinner. Maybe they had sex on the kitchen table, caught up in the excitement. It left him wistful, a little haunted. There was no one he could ask.
When he wasn’t sitting in his back office, batting out emails and applying his work to journals that he hadn’t had the chance to before his accident, he was sitting in Moblit’s studio, staring at the wall ahead of him.
Moblit had been kind enough to give Erwin a key; it had a separate entrance to the house and Moblit had so much space elsewhere. Erwin figured he had holed himself up in one of his galleries downtown, while Erwin claimed ownership here, if only for a little while.
It was getting late. He should get back to Mike’s; he’d promised a late-night session at the gym, but he was turning over the envelope Levi had handed him instead. Erwin squared it in his hands, too afraid to open it, of the man he had been when wrote those words.
“Enough,” he told himself, thumb peeling under the loose flap. A single sheet of folded paper fell out, filled with his own narrow writing in a dark blue ink.
Dear Levi
Last night, you were washing the dishes, and I was staring at you, tongue stuck to the roof of my mouth. You’d fallen into a tirade about one thing or another. Admittedly, I’m not too sure what about. I was focused too much on how you looked. Your hair was almost orange-blue with the setting sun behind you, and it never bothers you how it falls so often into your eyes. I’ve never understood that. I thought you looked beautiful. You are beautiful Levi. I’m not sure if anyone has ever told you that before. Did I tell you that? Back when we were… whatever we were. Putting a name to it always scared me. Still, I hope I told you how beautiful I found you back then. If I didn’t, know that I thought it.
Do you know what I think about most when I think about you? I think how we met almost as if by chance. I don’t think I’ve ever fallen asleep in a lecture before. In fact, I find it odd to fall asleep anywhere and yet that first time we met I was asleep. I’ve always felt safe around you, like I don’t have to guard myself . There’s few people I could say that about.
Whenever I was tearing myself up inside, you were there with your clipped words. Whenever I was in need of a good mothering (your words!) you provided it. You let me spend time with Isabel. Let me into your life and I deserted you. I’m sorry I did that.
I feel like I remember how to breathe when I see you. These recent weeks, sleeping on your couch, watching you and Isabel in your little routine, you never make me feel unwelcome, even when I can tell my conversation bores you, or my mess frustrates you. When you tell me my weight is flattening your couch cushions, I know it’s coming from a place inside that is good and kind.
I know what I want, and it’s you. It was always you. I was angry with myself for a long time and angry at my father too, but he’s gone now and I know I was a coward for letting everyone else’s thoughts cloud my mind.
All I want is simplicity… not to say you are simple, but our life together could be, and that’s what I want; what I crave. I want you and Izzy and to teach somewhere, like I admitted all those years back. This is me asking. If you still want me, of course - I understand I’ve put you through hell. I haven’t forgiven my actions or behaviours after my father’s funeral either. I know I have a lot to work on.
I know you won’t like this last part. I think you’re likely to never speak of it rather than cuss me out, though I will say it all the same: I am proud of you. Of what you have achieved.
The tea shop is a success! I know you hate it when I compliment you on your achievements, but look how far you’ve come, and you’re happy. I see your smiles when no one else does.
This has become arduous and winding and I know you’re already cursing me for it, but these are the thoughts that transfixed me last night and they’re the thoughts rolling around my head as I write this. They’re no doubt what I think of when I slip this into your bag; what I think of at the same time that you read this.
Izzy will always be your number one priority and I would never try to overtake that, but I would like to stand by your side as she continues to grow. You said once that you’d always been mine, but I’m yours too, if you’d have me.
Erwin read through it several times, dizzy with the outpouring of affection. He had done that, and Levi had let him. He couldn’t quite believe it. Erwin could imaging Levi sitting behind the counter in the afternoon lull, peeling open the letter and reading it for the first time. Despite his stoic nature, Levi was quick to flush. Perhaps he’d folded the letter away and tucked it into his apron. He likely shoved it back in his bag, ignored Petra if she asked him what was wrong.
He pulled open his phone, scrolled to Levi’s name, and opened up their messages.
Just read the letter. Did it work?
Yeah it did. Made ur cornyass promis never to right another
He smiled, tucked it into the blue envelope, and wrote the date (he’d dated it) on the strip of wallpaper. Fixing it further to the left. It was filling up with his scattered information. Photos he’d found in the cloud that had Hange and Moblit in them. His favourite was titled Christmas!! The three of them in matching hats, red with a white trim. From the angle of the camera, he presumed Levi had taken it and laughed.
Another of him and Armin standing awkwardly beside an enormous grandfather clock. They had auctioned the clock for an insane amount and brought a small amount of notoriety. This had come from Armin specifically, a cut-out from the local paper. He’d had it framed in his small apartment, but thought it suited Erwin’s needs more.

Erwin stood alone outside the airport, suit-bag folded over his arm, and hold-all at his feet. His head still ached with the remnants of the unsatisfactory argument he’d been having with Marie. It wasn’t really about the fact they’d caught the earlier flight than planned. And it wasn’t really that he hadn’t told her that Mike’s bachelor party was the night before the wedding, but her mood had turned sour the morning before. Any news of another wedding in their friendship circle set her relatives a twittering. They’ve been married for five years now. Wasn’t it time they started a family?
She wanted to, and he knew why. So many of her close friends were ripe with pregnant bellies over the last year, and it wasn’t as if she hadn’t been suggesting they do the same every six months or so.
The pull towards fatherhood had never been there. Didn’t dislike the company or children but didn’t yearn for a baby either. Yet Marie wanted them, and the older they got, the further into their thirties they slipped, the chances were slipping by. She’d known of his ambivalence early on, but he supposed knowing and believing were two separate things.
So they had argued and instead of arriving at the large home that Mike’s parents had rented for the night together, he found out that Marie had prearranged to spent the afternoon with Nana and the rest of the bride’s party, taking in the hotel’s grandiose spa and wellness bar.
He could have called a cab or an Uber, but instead it was Levi he’d messaged, asking if he could do the airport run. He recieved a thumbs up and a time he’d arrive. Levi was never late. He pulled up right on time in his banged up car, window rolling down to stare blankly at Erwin.
“You’re creasing your suit holding it like that,” Levi said, throwing open the door to grab at Erwin’s suit. He pulled up the driver’s seat and laid the suit out on the backseats as Erwin moved to the other side, folding himself into Levi’s car.
“Hi,” he said, when Levi pulled away from the drop off point, fading into the stream of traffic toward the city. “Thanks for this.”
“It’s fine,” Levi said. “You look like shit.”
“Oh?” Erwin rubbed at the back of his head, rolling his neck to guide out the stiffness. “How do you mean?”
“Tired I guess. Trying to look like your dad, huh? You need to shave.”
“You’re right.” His knuckles brushing beneath his chin. There’d been a few times recently, he’d stared at his reflection and caught glances of his father staring back. It pinched at his insides, made his chest hurt. He’d been raised to be different, better; stronger, at least.
Levi looked good, and Erwin focused on that as they drove. He’d broken up with Zeke some time ago now, though he had been vague in the reasons, but the style he had picked up when in that relationship stayed. He came dressed in smart slacks, a pale blue shirt tucked in, and nipped at his narrow waist.
“You look smart,” Erwin pointed out. Levi looked delicate but subtly masculine. He was wearing cologne.
“Yeah.” Levi rubbed at the back of his neck. His undercut was fresh, his black locks long at the front, tucked behind his ear where they grew too long. “I’ve just been at the school. Trying to make a decent impression. Isabel wants to join the wrestling team, but they don’t let girls in.”
“They didn’t when I was at school either.”
“Fuckin’ bullshit. I don’t think she even wants to wrestle and I don’t want those assholes touching her, but she just likes stirring shit up. Still, gotta support her choices, I guess. Was talking to the Principal, tried to get her on side.”
“Did it work?”
“Nah. Bitch took one look at me and figured it wasn’t worth it,” Levi snorted, fingers flexing on the steering wheel. He was always different when he talked about his kid; chin pointed a little higher, sitting a little taller. “I bought her some skates for her birthday. Maybe she’ll take up rollerblading or some shit.”
They talked back and forward for a while. Erwin asked if Levi was heading to the bachelor party, but Levi shook his head.
“I was invited, but me and Mike ain’t that close and I’ve got shit going on I need to deal with.”
“What shit?” Erwins first thought was a new boyfriend, which he would be happy about. He would force a fake smile on his face and count all the ways he was wrong for Levi silently.
“Kenny’s sick. Booze or cancer. Not sure.”
“He’s staying with you?” Erwin hadn’t known they were in contact. It had been patchy over the years. They had pulled Levi from his uncle’s care before he was pregnant, and when he left Louisiana, he’d always made it clear he had no intention of returning.
“Yep.” Levi’s voice was neutral, though his knuckles whitened on the wheel. Erwin wanted to reach over and shake his shoulder, press his hand down so Levi knew he wasn’t alone. He let him be. “He’s a dick, but he can tell Isabel stories about my mom that I can’t. Feels like a family, I guess. It’s fucked up. Soon he’s gonna be dead and it’ll just be me.”
Marie’s dress was hanging on the outside of the closet door when Erwin arrived at their room. Her make up spilling out over the vanity. The faint ghost of her perfume filling the room. Here, but not really. Erwin took a hot shower, and he shaved, mindful of Levi’s comment, and only stared at his reflection when it was fogged with steam so he didn’t see fragments of his father staring back.
The groom’s party met in the hotel bar, and Mike, wired on pre-wedding jitters, already seemed a little wasted. He slung a heavy arm over Erwin’s shoulders and pulled him in until their heads bumped, his nose scuffing Erwin’s cheekbone.
“Gonna be married in the morning. Fuck dude, fuck.”
“It isn’t so bad,” Erwin laughed. “You’ll feel the same, but different. More grown up.”
“I was thinking of crashing the girls’ night at the spa,” Mike said. “See my fiancee one last time.”
Erwin wanted to point out that Nana would still be his fiancee tomorrow, until the ceremony, but he didn’t want to ruin the moment, so he just shook his head and distracted him with a fresh whisky-sour.
It was just a few rounds with the guys; some Erwin knew, some that Mike knew or employed in his gym. It was good humour, and it was a sneaky joint on the porch before leaving. It was casual. Erwin was struggling to remember how to fit in.
“Remember your bachelor party?” Mike called to Erwin, eyes glazed, words slurred enough that Erwin shook his head at the friend that was on his way to purchase more alcohol. It wouldn’t do to have Mike wrecked the morning of his wedding.
“I rememberer,” Erwin said, mostly to be polite.
“Big rooftop bar. Couldn’t find you ’til I realised you’d be with shorty.”
“Shorty?” One of Mike’s friends called out, though no one bothered giving him a response.
Erwin wanted to speak, but his words were dulled by the memory of the two of them, sitting behind the plant pot, knees drawn to chest. Levi’s quiet suggestion, or plea, or confession. One of those three. Erwin rejected all the same. Had his fairytale wedding. Had his stale marriage, with his beautiful wife, who wasn’t talking to him.
“It was good of you to invite him.” Erwin’s words were polite, his tone clipped. Mike was too wasted to pick up on nuance, so he just shrugged a large shoulder.
“He ain’t bad, Smith. I like him when he ain’t making overtures toward married men.”
Erwin couldn’t sleep that night. He’d got back to his room after dumping Mike in his own, leaving him snoring happily in the centre of the bed, clothes on, shoes off. Marie was back, smelling strongly of various spa treatments. He looked at her in the room's darkness, hair sprawled over the pillows, pale shoulders bare against the thick sheets. He licked his dry lips and felt a sudden loss. Maybe it was the booze, though he had kept himself sober enough to watch out for Mike, to make sure he didn’t go too far.
He left the room and wandered to the hotel bar, ordered a soda water and sipped it in the darkest corner, tucked away from everyone else. His hands slipped to his phone, and his thumb slipped to Levi’s name, dialling before he could convince himself otherwise.
“Smith, what’s up?” Levi’s voice was hoarse through the speaker, like he’d been asleep. Erwin cringed inside. Levi rarely slept well, he hated to be the one to wake him.
“I want to ask a question. It’s odd.” Levi didn’t respond to Erwin’s icebreaker, so he continued all the same. “Did you know you wanted kids before you had Izzy?”
Levi was the wrong person to talk to and yet he was the only person Erwin knew that talked frankly about being a parent. Perhaps because most of his friends and work associates that had children were less involved, had the wealth that installed one parent at home, or a nanny.
“Why would you ask me that?” Levi almost laughed down the phone, just as Erwin saw the barman call for last orders. “You knocked Marie up?”
“No.” It came out quick, perhaps too defensive. He moved from his booth and walked from the bar, taking a seat instead in the empty lobby, stared at the lines in the carpet that the vacuum created. He’d need to go upstairs and back to his wife before she woke up and hated him even more. He cleared his throat. “We’ve discussed it, but I’m not sure I want any.”
“Babies just shit, scream and sleep. When they’re asleep, they're the best fuckin’ thing ever. Izzy was, anyway. She had these tiny hands, would fall asleep squeezing my finger. When she was hungry, she’d rub her mouth against my chest and I knew I’d never love anything more. Then they start eating actual food, and their shit turns vile, but you still gotta clean it up. Then they start crawlin’ and talkin’. If they’re all like Izzy, they never stop. Then they need new clothes cause they don’t stop growing, and you gotta hope when they hurt themselves - because they will - it ain’t gonna cost enough to poke your own eyeballs out to sell.” Levi stopped talking for a moment. Erwin heard him swallow. “Sometimes it’s weird knowing people choose to have ‘em. It wasn’t a conscious decision I made.”
“I’m sorry. It was insensitive of me to ask.”
“It wasn’t. I don’t mind. Sometimes you’re the only one that lets me talk like this and doesn’t look like they’re having a seizure.”
“Suppose there’s still time. I just don’t think I’m ready.”
Levi hesitated, pulling back from either a barb or a cutting truth. Either way, Erwin didn’t like him keeping it from him. “Yeah, well dudes can shoot their baby juice till like they’re half in the grave, right?”
“Levi, that’s disgusting,” Erwin chided, but he wasn’t mad. He missed Levi’s humour. “I miss you.”
“You’re drunk, blondie,”
“A little yes. Whiskey makes me wistful,” Erwin admitted. Wondering what Levi looked like right now. Was he still in that smart outfit he’d worn to impress Isabel’s Principal, or something cosier? It wouldn’t do him good to think of him, but it was always easier to keep thoughts of Levi out of his head when he was on the other side of the country.
“You always wanna talk to me when you’re wistful?”
“I always wanna talk to you. I just don’t know how.”
“Careful, or you’re gonna say something you regret,” Levi warned. His voice was quiet now, barely above a whisper. He could imagine Levi’s small mouth pressed to his ear as he spoke, but no — not right. Even drunk Erwin knew better. Wistful Erwin knew better than to follow down that path.
He cleared his throat, loud enough that Levi hissed down the phone. “You’re right. Goodnight Levi. See you tomorrow at the wedding.”
“Yeah. See ya tomorrow.”
“What are you and the wife fighting about?” Levi’s voice shot out from beside Erwin, pressed as they were against the wall. They’d all survived the ceremony, and they’d all survived the sitdown dinner, even Levi, who’d been yelled at by a mother for his daughter’s behaviour, and belittled by a drunk university friend, who remembered Levi just on the jobs he had taken back then.
“You okay?” Erwin asked, avoiding the question. Marie was dancing with Hange right now, laughing brightly, wider in a way that he hadn’t seen her smile at him with for a while now.
“Can you believe that cocksucker asking if I was still a fuckin janitor? Ain’t nothing wrong with being a janitor.”
“Not at all,” Erwin agreed. “But you’re not a janitor. You should have told him that.”
“I don’t owe him shit.”
“That’s true.”
“So why are you and Marie fighting? Is it about the kiddie shit?” Uncomfortable at being reminded of their phone call from the night before, Erwin scratched the back of his head, wished he was drunker. He turned to Levi, saw him sipping delicately at his mojito.
“I think so. She doesn’t always like coming back here.”
“Why?”
“You know why.” It came out quick, too honest, but Levi’s eyes burned when he stared at him, and when he took another little sip, Erwin watched the bobbing of his throat. “When you were with Zeke, it was easier, I suppose. Why did you guys break up?”
“We were boring each other to death. Being with Zeke was easier for Marie?”
“For me.” He watched Levi’s slim eyebrows raise at the words, watched him drain his glass as he fell to his own emotions. “Fuck.”
“What?” Levi’s voice was unbearably light and amused as he followed Erwin from the furthest wall in the dance hall to the empty hallway; the stairs leading up to the sprawl of bedrooms. It was too early in the night for anyone else to be around, but still Erwin lowered his voice as he turned to Levi.
“It’s nothing. I spoke without thinking,” he started, trying to ignore the smirk on Levi’s face, the way his cheeks flushed.
“You finally ready to be honest with me? Only been waiting how many years now?”
“I don't know what you’re talking about,” Erwin said, but his words faded as Levi approached. Levi, who looked so goddamn good, narrow hips highlighted by the slight curve in his suit jacket; his boots were not wedding suitable at all, but the perfect match to his daughter’s; to his own style.
“Kiss me. I know you want to.” Levi stepped closer, the warmth of his body, his feet tucking inside of Erwin’s. His own heart was racing, his mouth filling. The emotion of the day, Levi reacting like this for whatever reason, leaning into the space they had forced between them all those years back. “Kiss me like a fuckin’ man, asshole.”
Erwin gripped the back of Levi’s head, damp with sweat, small against the palm of his hand as he leaned down, fixing Levi against him, turning him on a graceful spin, so it was Levi pressed to the wall, hidden from view.
Levi’s mouth was on him, his small fingers sliding to the bend of his elbows, pinching hard, pulling Erwin down so it wasn’t just on him. Erwin opened his mouth to take a breath, to resist, but Levi took his chance, slipped his tongue inside.
How long had it been since their last kiss? Levi’s nineteenth birthday; that sad desperate thing it had been, wet with Levi’s tears. Now it was different. Levi’s experience, and his confidence and the ease of the alcohol and Erwin’s own sudden willingness.
They were hidden in a lost corridor in this damn Manor House, but still Erwin fumbled his hand behind Levi, catching on a handle. The door opened, and he broke their lips, just briefly, watching the easy smile stretch over Levi’s swollen mouth as they fell into the linen closet.

Erwin was standing in Moblit’s studio, staring fondly at the photo of himself and Armin and the grandfather clock, when he heard the internal door slide open. He turned his head, surprised to see Pieck standing there. She was in her pink work scrubs, with shadows under her eyes and her hair pinned up. He smiled at her, and she nodded.
“Hello,” she said, coming to stand beside him. There wasn’t much between her and Levi in size, leaving Erwin to feel a little oversized. He still felt unnerved in her company, aware that she knew far more of the bad bits.
“It’s coming along nicely,” she said, stepping to the display, smiling particularly at the Christmas photo with Moblit and Hange. “Are you remembering anything?”
“No.” It was something he’d had to come to terms with. The fragments he had recalled had been intermittent and less frequent the longer he lived in his new reality. Even the parts he had remembered, like his father’s funeral, were bare memories in the grand scheme. “I’m trying to be okay with that.”
“Levi says you spoke. He also told me to tell you he had a shitty last therapy session because of it.”
Erwin laughed, because he knew Levi would want him to. “He was honest with me about some stuff. We’re in a better place because of it.”
“He wanted me to give you this.” She handed him a plain brown envelope, thick and unlabelled. “Photos from Isabel’s collection.”
“Thank you,” he said, watching her smile.
“I’ll leave you to it.” Her smile was faint, but meaningful, and he watched her leave with a tired expression.
Erwin and Armin grew close over the days spent together, poring over photos. It was easier than being in Mike and Nana’s house; the dear friends they were, but they seemed separate from his current project. Mike had complicated it with his interference and Erwin tried to be polite, conscientious and always complimented Nana’s cooking while he ate with them, but he did his laundry at the laundrette across from the antique store, deposited rent money in their bank account and stayed out of their way.
It was different with Armin. Their relationship had mostly been professional before the accident. Now they debated philosophy over coffee breaks. Armin convinced Erwin to meet in person with the faculty staff he’d be working with at the college and he felt so much better about where he would be, come the new semester. Professor Smith, with his own office and his own lecture hall. He’d be teaching at his former law school. He wondered if he’d ever end up teaching in the hall he first met Levi in. the thought overwhelmed him, had him swallowing the lump in his throat.
“Have you looked through the photos Levi gave you yet?” Armin asked. There was pizza on Erwin’s desk in his back office and they both should have called it a night hours ago, but Armin was far too invested in Erwin’s private life to leave. He had friends, those two from the photo, but he seemed lonely all the same.
“Not yet,” Erwin admitted with a sigh. He pulled open his desk drawer, to where he has stuffed the wad of photos he hadn’t been able to look at them when. Pieck had handed them over. All he had done was send Levi a quick thank you text for them. Levi had posted a little thumbs up in response, but nothing else.
“You should. If you don’t fix things with him, and he doesn’t come here to clean this office up, I worry.” Armin looked sheepishly around the room. Erwin followed his lead. It wasn’t looking its best; between the pizza box sitting on the paperwork gathering on the desk, and the dust collecting on the windowsill, it was falling into disarray.
“I suppose we could look now?” Erwin said. He thought he’d prefer to look with Armin, who was less exposed to Erwin’s relationship than Hange’s family, and therefore would come into it almost as blind as Erwin. No bias or digression.
He cleared away the pizza and wiped his fingers clean. Grease stains on the photos were a surefire way to divorce, Erwin was certain. Then he pulled open the envelope and cleanly split the pile of photos into two; handing one stack to Armin. He turned his pile over and noticed Isabel’s messy scrawl across the back; it was dated.
“Try to order the photos in your stack,” Erwin said, sitting back in his creaking leather chair, feeling daft from the nerves in his chest. “We’ll try to pop them into a timeline.”
The first photo was relatively easy to date, if the scrawl of high school graduation bitches!! wasn’t clear enough. Isabel stood between Erwin and Levi, high school graduation gown askew. She had the widest grin of the three of them, though Levi wasn’t far behind. Levi was wearing his ring, he was holding onto Isabel’s cap, her hair a mess from where it must have rested for at least a short amount of time.
“Armin, could you check my search history? Anything that mentions GED testing,” Erwin said, testing the nugget of something playing at the back of his head. Armin lent forward from his position, photos to his chest as he tapped the spacebar, waking up the laptop. A quick spill of his fingers against the keys had Armin nodding his head.
“Looks like you were searching for old test papers a few months back, and…” Armin stopped to read the screen “Yeah, you checked the library for textbooks. How did you guess?”
He stared down at the photo again, at Levi’s proud face, his arm around his daughter’s shoulders. “Just intuition, I guess.”
They went back and forward. Armin would come across a photo; Erwin with his face painted grey and green, a zombie for a school project Isabel was working on, or a Fourth of July party in the tearoom, Levi unable to hide his disgust at the decorations littering his teashop even in the photos.
Erwin couldn’t remember, but as he stared at the photos, he knew he was feeling the same emotion now that he had at the time; desperate love and affection, disbelief that this was his life. He’d lost so much of what he’d believed made him a success; young professional, married to a young professional, with their professional friends and dinner parties, with their condo in the Golden State, and the wealth oozing from their suits, cars, and expansive wine collection. This now, sitting in this little back office, with the stale scent of greasy pizza in the air, with Armin, a boy half as lost as he was in life, was closer to what he’d wanted his life to be than anything else.
“I’m not sure what’s stranger, that you got Levi into Disney World, or that he’s wearing Minnie Mouse ears,” Armin said with a laugh, handing over his photo.
Erwin looked at it; it was different from the one Levi had originally placed on his desk. He had the Mickey ears to Levi’s Minnie’s, and they looked tired, but happy. Levi had sunburn over the bridge of his nose. Erwin was wearing a Donald Duck T-shirt.
He found a photo from their wedding, not dissimilar to the one in their kitchen, in their simple suits and the flowers clutched in Levi’s hand. Erwin had never seen a smile as wide on his own face, it distorted his features. He could imagine Levi mocking him for it. In fact, was almost adamant he had. Isabel was in this photo too, her green eyes looking wet, even if her face was bright and cheerful. She had strings of silver beads fixed to a headband in her vibrant hair, and it looked brushed and painstakingly curled, the neatest Erwin had ever seen it.
At the bottom of the pile was a photo dated from early last year. They were in their backyard, Erwin with his arm over Levi’s shoulders, the two of them staring down the lens at Isabel, presumably. Levi looked thinner, his hair in need of a cut and his skin pale and sallow, hiding himself beneath Erwin. Dad’s first day home <3 read the back, and Erwin took it to mean he was fresh out of the hospital after the miscarriage. His heart hurt looking at Levi. He’d never seen him look like that before, small and vulnerable and openly sad with no veneer of confidence, faked or otherwise.
When Erwin finished staring at the photos, Armin took them from him gently, and organised them into the correct order. Then, sensing that Erwin perhaps needed some time alone, he left for the night, promising to see him the next morning.
Erwin spent the next night staring at his wall, carefully pinning the photos up, and scrawling the information Isabel had written on the back to the front. Part of him thought maybe it was too self indulgent to have a wall of photos dedicated to himself, but as he stared at it, at the photos Levi had provided, the newspaper cuttings Armin had, as well as the input from Hange and Moblit, the blank spaces in his memory was filling up. He couldn’t remember, but he could see it for himself. People loved him, these were his friends and his family and it had nothing to do with success or work or anything other than being the person he was.
It made him uncomfortable a little; it made him feel loved. A squirming sensation in the pit of his stomach that had him gripping for his phone, sliding to Levi’s name and typing a quick message.
Can we meet, Levi? I need to see you.
Party at the teashop tomorow . You can come
Erwin smiled, nodding his head.
“Would Levi want me to come?” Armin said, when Erwin saw him the next day and invited him along. Erwin had decided he’d prefer if the kid came with him. He couldn’t really say why, only he genuinely enjoyed the company, and he was feeling overwhelmed about the idea of a party. He couldn’t think what it was for.
“It’s not just about Levi,” Erwin told him. “And he’ll be fine with it, anyway.”
“Has he seen your wall?”
“No, but I think I’m ready to show him.”
They arrived after five once they’d closed the antique store early and driven over to Levi’s teashop. He could see that the seats that sat outside were no longer cluttering the sidewalk and that the closed sign was flipped on the door. As they approached, and he knocked, he could see the inside, warm and brightly lit, a scattering of familiar faces inside.
Furlan opened the door, and he smiled widely at the two of them. Erwin recalled the last time he had seen him, how he’d been hiding in the back of the coffee shop he’d met Levi in. Neither of them broached the subject.
“Oi, you made it.” Erwin and Armin stepped inside to see Levi staring at them, his arms crossed. He was no longer wearing his green apron, just a plain white t-shirt and black jeans. His arms folded over his chest and he was staring between the two of them. “You brought a plus one.”
“Oh I can go,” Armin said. Erwin could feel the kid turning red beside him.
“Nah, I didn’t say that,” Levi said. “Nice to see you, Armin. How filthy has he let the office get?”
“Well, we’ve sort of been preoccupied,” Armin started, but Erwin watched Levi roll his eyes. He wasn’t bothered. They could sort it out. Erwin looked around the teashop. Isabel was there with Gabi and Falco. As far as he could see, there were no other guests.
“What’s the party for?” Erwin said eventually. He wanted to go to Levi, to kiss his cheek or throw an arm around his shoulders, to tell him he was ready to see what they could do about fixing this. Instead, he just stood in front of him, hands behind his back.
“Gabi’s birthday. Falco let it slip last week. It’s only us, just cake and tea and shit.” Levi shrugged his shoulders. He looked worried at the mention of the two kids, but he didn’t need to be.
“That’s very kind of you.”
“Shut up. So you and little blondie get on well, huh? You adopted him or something?” Levi said. Armin was turning to browse the teapots sitting along the far wall, while Furlan and Falco had their sleeves up. The young boy had a serious expression on his face as he took to mixing various dried leaves and fruits into an empty jar on the counter.
In the back office, with the door ajar, Isabel was strapping Gabi into a pair of old skates, her mouth moving quickly, though Erwin couldn’t catch it. He turned to Levi, following him into taking a seat at one of the small tables in the corner.
“He’s a good kid, and he’s about as clueless as I am about my private life, which has worked out well,” Erwin said, fading back into conversation with Levi, smiling when he watched Levi try to hide his laugh. “Thank you for the photos.”
“You already said that,” Levi said quietly.
“I know. Do you think when we’re finished here — would you like to come back to Moblit’s studio with me to see it? I want to show you and speak to you about things.” Erwin studied Levi, sipping his tea.
“Yeah all right.”
It was a relatively quiet afternoon of tea and cake. Eventually Gabi was steady enough on the skates to take a turn around the tearoom, hands splayed out to balance herself. Levi had already prepared, pushing most of the tables and chairs to the walls, and though he stared down a little frantically at his polished floorboards, he kept his complaints to the minimum.
They all cheered when she skated pass, a little off balanced at first, but she was picking up quickly. After a while Falco rushed to Gabi’s side, and Isabel brought Armin into the conversation she was having with Furlan. Whatever it was, Armin was growing more red-cheeked by the second, Isabel’s dirty cackle getting louder until Levi yelled at her half-heartedly. Mostly Erwin just enjoyed sitting with Levi, in his teashop, the mad scrap of kids surrounding them.
“Gabi, I made you the perfect tea blend for your birthday,” Falco said, holding out his arm so she could grab hold of it as she skated past. Whatever the rest of the conversation was, Erwin ducked out of it, staring at Levi instead.
“What?” Levi asked, scowling, but Erwin shook his head. He reached his hand out halfway and Levi looked down at it. He left Erwin waiting, but eventually he slipped his own in it.
Levi had made a simple vanilla cake as a celebration, and twelve candles were lit as they sang a quick rendition of Happy Birthday. She looked mortified, and a little overwhelmed, but she was still young enough to close her eyes as she thought of a wish, blowing out the candles. Erwin didn’t have to think too hard about what she wished for.
“I’ve decided to forgive you,” Isabel said, when Levi was helping the kids into their coats, tucking slices of cake into Falco’s rucksack. He’d even finished a whole cup of Falco and Furlan’s blended tea and decided it wasn’t half bad. He’d poured the rest of the blend into a glass jar and tucked it onto the shelf with the rest, promising he’d keep it just for them. Falco had never looked more proud, Erwin thought, or he’d never seen a kid that age look quite so serious about tea.
“I appreciate I’ve been terrible,” Erwin said to Isabel. Sometimes it was still hard remembering that she was now grown; as serious as she was playful, as protective of her father as he was of her.
“More or less. He’s happier when you’re around. He always has been. So, I don't have much choice.” Isabel looked mortified to even be saying this. Erwin chuckled, reached out an arm and let her hug him. She was small, like her father, but far more accepting of hugs than he’d ever been.
With the kids gone, and Isabel roping Armin into a night out with her and Furlan, Erwin spent a little while helping Levi put the teashop back into its usual order, dragging him out when he could. Pieck’s pale blue Fiat was in the driveway of Hange’s and Moblit’s house when they pulled up, but Erwin pulled him around to the side entrance, so they weren’t spotted.
“You ever think you might have outstayed your welcome? You’ve been taking up his studio for weeks now,” Levi said, following Erwin through the side door and into the studio. The lights flickered on, and the strip of paper revealed itself.
It was no longer just scattered with photos here and there, but filled with words and dates too. Photos from Isabel’s collection; the wedding, Disney World, first dates, and events; Armin’s more detailed input, things pulled from emails, his work achievements, printouts of articles in journals. Even Mike had helped throw a few images in when he’d discovered what Erwin had been doing; photos of the two of them on hikes, or with Nana and the dogs.
It was a whole life uncovered, a version of himself that he didn’t know, but felt connected to, far more than he had in his previous life, and far more than he had in the life he and Levi had lived briefly, built mostly on Levi's lies.
“You remember any of it?” Levi asked, staring up at the collage, at the various forms of him in the photos, of the family they’d created in the small time they’d been together.
“I’m afraid not.” he stepped behind Levi, sighed when he leaned back to Erwin’s chest. His arms slipped around Levi, holding him against his chest. They were quiet for a few minutes as Levi looked at the board of photos. Erwin’s eyes slipped to Isabel’s high school graduation again, and he pressed a gentle kiss to Levi’s crown.
“I know you were thinking of taking the GED exam,” Erwin said quietly. Levi froze up in his arms, but as Erwin’s arms held him a little tighter, he relaxed.
“I got Izzy through school and into community college, I think, like, maybe I could do it. I’d only mentioned it a few times, and I know I’d fail ‘cause you know I can’t spell for shit and I know I’m st—”
“Don’t finish that,” Erwin warned. “You have time to do it now. I can help, if you’d like me to.”
“Well, technically, I guess you are a professor.” Of law, not high school diplomas, and yet he still envisioned Levi being the trickiest student to boot. He’d give it a chance, though.
Levi turned in his arms and pulled down on his shoulders so their mouths could meet. They kissed like desperate men, biting teeth and catching tongues, Levi leaning heavily on him, lifting onto his toes. Levi’s comment about Erwin always feeling like fire flooded through his mind as he grappled and grasped, heard the soft sigh as Levi’s mouth opened against his own.
Erwin’s slid his hands down Levi’s body, felt the ripple of muscle beneath his clothes. Levi’s hands curled up to fists, as Erwin tugged at his belt, parting it and yanking Levi’s button and fly open with force. His hand pressed inside, cupping up against Levi’s underwear, feeling his heat.
“Erwin,” Levi sighed, eyes fluttering shut as he traced over his growth, sensitive through the fabric. God, he had missed Levi, the safety in his body, the strength and vulnerability he held. “Fuck, you’re moving fast.”
He yanked Levi’s briefs down to his knees and sank down to his own, the scent of Levi strong as he rubbed his nose into the crease of his pelvis bone.
“Give me your colour,” he said, breathless, catching against Levi’s skin. Above him, Levi’s hands fisted into his hair, pulling him close, his nose rolling into the folds between Levi’s legs.
“Green, you motherfucker.”
“Hmm.” Erwin agreed against Levi’s skin, setting his knees to shake. It was quick work; dirty work. He just wanted to fuck Levi, bring him pleasure, show him how much he loved him. He used the tip of his tongue to circle around Levi’s hole, loosening him up, grabbing onto his hip with one large hand, rolling his thumb over where he was so hard and sensitive.
Levi was quiet in bed, was quiet now in Moblit’s studio with Erwin between his legs. He wanted to lay him out, wanted to spread him wide and fuck into his delicious, perfect body but he wanted to stay here more, where Levi was clenching around his tongue, nails digging into Erwin’s scalp, he wanted to lay back with Levi’s thighs fixed by his ears and let him ride his face until he was drowning in his release. Wanted to love him in all the most desperate ways. Over and over until Levi was spent and could give nothing more.
Levi didn’t last long. A slide of Erwin’s thick tongue inside him, a firm rub of his growth with the pad of his wide thumb and Levi’s thighs were shaking, and he was clenching over and over, fingers tight.
Afterward, they were on the floor. Levi’s thighs still shaking as he climbed over Erwin, kissing at his jaw, rubbing at his scalp in an apology of his rough handling. Erwin accepted it, didn’t point out that Levi was rubbing up against him like an affectionate cat.
After a while, it became uncomfortable, laying as they were on Moblit’s studio floor. Levi was warm though, and had tucked one hand beneath Erwin’s shirt to rest against his ribs. It wasn’t worth moving for the world.
“How did we marry? Did I propose?” It was something he had questioned. Looking through the photos he had, he’d realised it was a quiet intimate affair, but nothing else specific.
“Like hell you didn’t propose,” Levi grunted. “The idea of belonging to anyone like that freaks me the fuck out. Being someone’s husband or whatever, but not you. You just suggested it. I picked the rings with Izzy and we just did it. Didn’t tell anyone until they saw my ring.”
Erwin smiled at the memory he didn’t remember. The thing that confused him the most was that he’d always refused to wear the ring on his finger. Shame, he thought, at how he had disrespected his previous marriage. Maybe he had wanted to keep this one private, and all to himself.
He still wasn’t wearing the ring around his neck, but he thought he’d put it on when he was back at Mike’s, packing his bag to return home, if he was allowed. This time he wanted to wear it on his finger, so everyone could see. That he was Levi’s, as much as the other way.
“I know there are parts you don’t remember, things that make you feel guilty, but I had the conversations with you already and I don’t know if I can stomach them again. You gotta get that through your skull, blondie,” Levi said quietly, pulling Erwin’s attention back. He’d propped himself up with his free hand, elbow to the floor, chin to palm.
“I understand,” Erwin said, reaching out to tuck some of Levi’s hair back behind his ear. “Just tell me when I’m overstepping.”
“Don’t ask me how I felt on my nineteenth birthday for one,” Levi said. “‘Cause that had a real long-term affect and I’m not interested in ever revisiting it. We did it once. Didn’t talk for three days ‘cause I don’t think you realised what it did to me back then.”
“Noted.” He bit back the apology. Levi wouldn’t want another sorry when he was trying to set boundaries for them.
“All right.” Levi sat up properly and then did up his pants from before. He rose to his feet and held out his hand. Erwin grabbed it and groaned, too old to be sprawled on hard surfaces these days. When he made it to his feet, he put his hands on Levi’s shoulders, touching lightly, and then a little harder until Levi let out a long sigh.
He leaned down all the way, so that Levi didn’t have to rise, so he could capture Levi’s mouth against his own, the taste of Levi still faint on his tongue. Both their lips were dry, and Levi’s lashes tickled against his cheekbones, but it was worth it to feel Levi’s hands finally reach out and hold on to his waist.
They kissed until Erwin’s back ached from how he was curved over, but Levi wasn’t going anywhere, pressing his face into Erwin’s chest, fingers gripping tight to Erwin’s shirt at the back. Erwin held him, rested his chin on the top of his head, and spoke.
“I have to sell my father’s place.”
“What?” Levi pulled away, head pushing up to meet Erwin’s eyes. He stroked his thumb against Levi’s pointed chin and smiled.
“The house needs to be sold. I wasn’t ready before, but I am now. It served my family, but it serves no one sitting empty as it does now and it’s time to move on from it. I’ve spoken to my attorney about it already, but I wondered something else.”
“What?” Levi sounded unnerved, hands on Erwin’s wrists as he held him in place.
“I think if we combined the money from the sale of my father’s house with the house we’re in now, perhaps we could buy something bigger.”
Levi’s features hardened. “You want me to sell my house?”
“Not if you don’t want to, only it is quite small for the future. Isabel should always have a room with us, not somewhere she has to share. More rooms would be helpful too, if we were to look into fostering. And an office for my work.”
“What are you saying, Erwin?”
“That my life is with you. My dream job, my dream man,” he said that part a little deeper and winced when Levi dropped his hands to pinch at his sides. “I want what you want. This afternoon was the best afternoon I’ve had in a really long time. Just being with you, and family, whatever that means.”
Levi stepped away, hands shaking at his sides. He turned to stare up at the wall of photographs, at Erwin’s lost memories.
“You mean it?”
“Of course I mean it.”
“All right then,” Levi looked at him again, and then he was kissing Erwin’s mouth, too harsh, their teeth clipping together, though it just made Erwin laugh. He held tight to Levi, squeezing him close, even if it was too much. Levi would tell him if it was too much. “All right.”
