Chapter 1
History Retold - The Wake Scene

There were too many people in his father’s house. That was all Erwin could think about.

Distant aunts and uncles in stiff black outfits milled around, shaking his hand, or pulling him in close; friends of his father that he recalled from his practicing days — even the old man that worked at his father’s shop. They filled the house with unusual noise and clutter, chewing on stale sandwiches and drinking wine from the old glasses that normally sat on the top shelf of his late grandmother’s dresser.

Levi was here, of course. He’d been with Erwin’s father in his final few weeks, when Erwin hadn’t been able to come back — when he thought he’d still have time. They had spoken little since Erwin had returned home, and Levi moved around the house like a server rather than part of the family. Picking up empty glasses, darting out of the way of the cluster of seventy-year-olds with wandering eyes and unchecked opinions on their faces.

There was a booming laugh in the kitchen and then the sharp sound of glass breaking. Erwin watched Levi flinch briefly before shuffling off, and he followed, lurking in the doorframe. Erwin’s uncle had dropped a bottle of red wine on the floor, his cheeks well-flushed with alcohol. When he saw Levi, he moved to the side, watching as he bent down to pick up the larger shards of green glass.

Erwin finally stepped into the room to help when his eyes met his uncle's, moving to open the cupboard where he knew the dustpan lived, surprised to find it empty.

“Oh.”

“We moved it. It’s under the sink,” Levi said, dropping the larger shards up onto a countertop. Erwin moved, wondering when they moved it, why they moved it. Some lost conversation he would never have with his father. Mundane, but forgotten.

Levi grabbed the dustpan, brushing up the glass, asking Erwin to find a cloth to soak up the cheap Merlot staining the floor red. 

“What that the last of the wine?” His uncle asked Erwin, ignoring Levi, who shook his head. 

“I’ll have a look in the cellar,” Levi said, pouring the crushed glass into the trashcan as Erwin cleaned the worst of it up. He watched Levi disappear through the heavy white door that lead into the basement.

“He isn’t the waitstaff,” Erwin reminded his uncle, clapping a hand on his shoulder. “Don’t treat him like it.”

“More like my brother's project when his son up and left,” he said. “Not that I blame you, my boy. What a life you have out in California now. A beautiful wife, I’ve seen photos of the house online. Your father was proud of you.”

“Thank you,” he said, the heavy sink of his stomach and tight squeeze of his chest happening at the same time. It made him dizzy. “I should see if Levi needs any help.”

Erwin followed where Levi disappeared to. Closing the door behind him and pacing down the handful of steps. Levi had his back to him, on his hands and knees, peering through the shelves of dusty wine. 

“He made me promise to serve ‘em the cheap shit,” Levi said, pulling out a dark bottle of wine. The label was dusty and Levi didn’t appear thrilled to be holding it. He dropped it down onto the old fold-up table in the far corner, eyeing up Erwin. “Why are you down here, Erwin? You should be upstairs with your family, or are you that drunk?”

“The only thing I’m drunk on right now is grief.” He looked down at his hands, at the wedding band breaking up his long, solid fingers. The cufflinks pinning his long black sleeves tight to his wrists. “Thank you for being here with him when I couldn’t. I’ve been too much of a coward to return when I know he’s been sick. I thought I’d have more time.”

Levi sat down on the wine barrel beside where Erwin stood, tucking his hands between his knees. He was in a long black sweater, frayed a little along the cuffs. “You’re not a coward, you’re a fuckin’ hotshot lawyer. It doesn’t matter. It didn’t matter to him.”

“I should have come home sooner.”

“You’re home now,” Levi said, but he glanced away. “Sorry, that’s not what I meant. This isn’t your home anymore. I just meant you grew up here.”

Erwin understood. He stared at Levi’s profile. The babyness of his features had long since slipped away, leaving something more refined. Youthful, but a little more hollow. “I’m glad he had you here.”

“Yeah.”

Above them, Erwin could hear the guests walking around, the soft sound of the stereo and gentle laughter. He knew this was just another way for people to catch up with one another, his father’s death just a reunion for those rarely seen relations. 

“You shouldn’t run around after them upstairs,” Erwin said. “Dad treated you and Isabel like family. You should grieve with the rest of us.”

“What am I supposed to do?” He asked. “He’s right, you know? I was a pet project for your dad. We both know that. He felt bad because the relationship was over and he felt some weird obligation to monitor me.”

There was some truth to that, the way it always sat between the three of them during the times Erwin came home. “Perhaps I shouldn’t have listened to him. Perhaps I should have stayed with you.”

“Nah, I would’ve held you back. You didn’t need me or my kid hanging around when you had so much more going for you. It sucked, but he was probably right.”

“Maybe. I don’t know.” Erwin dropped his head into his hands, falling into a crouch. He was married, he had Marie upstairs, entertaining his odd family. But Levi was beside him. Levi was always beside him. “Maybe we should have run away together.”

Levi snorted, “Hey I offered you that. I distinctly remember humiliating myself at your bachelor party.”

Erwin remembered Levi’s green shirt, his firm words, how they sat crouched beside each other on the rooftop until Levi couldn’t bear it. “I wouldn’t say you humiliated yourself.”

“That’s what it felt like.” Erwin watched Levi’s head drop between his shoulders, his hands folded over on his lap. His hands were always so small. Erwin remembered holding them within his own when they were… whatever they were together, watching them disappear between the folds of his own wide palms. He recalled cuddling up in Levi’s small bed, kissing his cheeks red, always so mindful of how he could and couldn’t touch him.

Erwin had a sudden desire to reach out and hold them again, like he did when they were both so shy. No, neither had been shy, but Levi had been traumatised and they were taking it slow. Erwin had so seriously wanted to take it slow, to make it work.

“You’ve never gotten over me,” Erwin said. Quietly, like a whisper, never cruel. 

“Fuck off.” Levi’s hands clawed into fists, but he remained still. Eventually Erwin sensed him softening. “It’s first love. It’s supposed to be rotten.”

“I’m the same.” Erwin shifted from his crouch until he was on his knees by Levi’s feet. He reached for Levi’s fist, gentle at first, waiting to see if Levi pulled back. 

“You have a wife,” Levi said, but he didn’t resist. He didn’t stop Erwin from pulling his hand, or gently uncurling all of his fingers, or stop him from leaning down to kiss his palm. “Erwin.”

The inside of Levi’s hand was warm, a little dry. He could taste the faded soap and a little of the wine from the bottle he’d rescued from the floor. His father was dead and Levi was here. Levi was always here. Erwin kissed Levi’s palm, and then the inside of his wrist. He pushed the cable-knit sweater upward to reach the pale expanse of his forearm and kissed him there, too. Higher and higher until Levi jerked his hand away.

“I can’t resist you,” Levi said, his eyes wet like shining metal. “Don’t fuckin’ do this if you can’t follow through.”

Erwin wasn’t really sure what Levi meant, he just knew he needed him. Needed to feel him, hold him, knew that Levi alone would be enough to make this better. He always did, somehow. Erwin stood up, grabbing Levi along the way and pulling him up with hands beneath his arms until he was standing, Erwin crowding over him. 

Levi didn’t stop him at all, instead his mouth opened as Erwin kissed him, those hands clasping on Erwin’s shoulders, nails digging in. 

Erwin’s hands slipped to Levi’s hips, pushing up his sweater to feel his warm skin beneath. He felt so different to what he was used to these days; with the domesticated sweetness of his soft-figured wife. Levi was firm and narrow in the places he knew only curves. So small. His back ached from where he was leaning over so he shifted, Levi moving up onto his toes to take control of some of the height. 

Erwin kissed down his jaw, breathing in the warm scent of him. Levi wore no cologne, just the faded remains of his soap. Sandalwood, jasmine. Erwin was suddenly so aware of Levi, and what he wanted. What he needed from him. He could feel himself growing in his own slacks, his hands full of Levi’s tight body, the way he sighed when Erwin captured his mouth again. So different from what it had been like nearly a decade ago.

Levi’s jeans were black and loose at the waist with enough give that Erwin could easily slip the button free from the hole. He did so, and then slid his hand down into Levi’s underwear, cupping him. 

“Hey fuck!” Levi mumbled against him, panting. As he pulled back, Erwin watched the rapid fluttering of his eyelashes. “Hey, you want this? You really want me?”

“Need to have you,” Erwin said. He slipped his hand out from the front of Levi’s jeans, and moved instead to yank them down to his knees, his underwear with it. God, he’d wanted to take his time with him back in the day. When he’d last seriously thought about doing this. 

He’d always stopped until now. Thought about his beautiful wife and the beautiful life they had built together on his father’s word. The life he knew he couldn’t have had with Levi.

He barely had the chance to look at Levi, at the dark hair between his thighs, before he was looking around. The wine barrel Levi had perched on seemed the best for the height difference. He pushed Levi gently over towards it.

“I didn’t want it to be like this,” he said, as Levi bent over. “But I have to have you.”

“Want you so fuckin’ bad,” Levi responded. “Don’t fuckin go.”

“I’m not.” Jesus. Erwin couldn’t even think. He slipped open his belt, pulled down his zipper, and took himself into his hand for a moment. Levi had spat into his own hand, and was pushing it between his thighs, getting himself wetter. For Erwin. 

He spat on his cock, slicking himself up. He could barely see, barely think straight, but that’s what he needed. If he thought too hard, he’d remember that they shouldn’t do this. He shouldn’t do this, but still he moved closer. The angle wasn’t right. He pushed at the small of Levi’s back, pushed his thighs further apart and pressed the head of his cock to Levi.

It didn’t feel like fucking his wife, and he was grateful for that. Levi was tighter, not as wet and quieter too. When it was still too painful to push in, Erwin spat into his hand and wiped it against Levi’s heated skin, pushing into him. It helped the breach as he angled himself against Levi.

Levi whined high and sweet as Erwin entered him, one slow inch at a time. When nothing else would fit, Erwin pressed him down against the barrel, pinning him in place as he rolled his hips. Oh fuck. He was tight. He was good. Erwin had thought of this. Thought of Levi. And it shouldn’t have been like this. It was supposed to be in a bed; it was supposed to be Levi’s legs around his waist and gentle encouragement and soft kisses. Instead, his teeth dragged against Levi’s sweater, biting down over the fabric, the fibres sticking to his tongue. He could hear the slap of their skin, of his hips slamming into Levi’s ass as the noises of his father’s wake continued above. Beneath him, he could hear the sobbing moans from Levi, begging Erwin to go harder beneath his breath.

Erwin came on a sharp thrust, face buried into Levi’s neck, over before he had really begun. The relief of it was a shock. And he would have been sorry for how quick he had finished if he wasn’t so relieved by his own body shutting down. He’d fucked the grief-soaked adrenaline out and now he had this, another mess. Another situation he didn’t know how to handle. 

“I’m sorry,” he said, wiping at his face. He caught sight of his cum as it dripped out of Levi, down the insides of his thighs. Levi remained bent over as Erwin stepped back, stuffing his damp cock back into his slacks, tightening his belt.

“You done having your crisis or you need more mothering?”

Levi had said that to him once when he’d sobbed all over him previously. Not that either of them had ever known a damn thing about mothers. Not that Erwin had ever known what had made his mind so broken in these ways. But he’d always been there, hadn’t he? When Erwin needed him.

“Need to pull myself together,” he said, his voice a husk. Levi was mostly the only person he’d ever allowed to see him in this state, but he felt foolish for it now. And guilty for what he had done. “I need a moment before I go upstairs. People will wonder where I’ve gone.”

He heard Levi pulling his jeans back up. The shaking puffs of breath. Erwin wiped rapidly at his cheeks, feeling the sting as they dried.

“My father is dead,” he said, watching Levi bend to pick up the bottle of wine. His face shifted, but Erwin wouldn’t know if it was pain or discomfort at Erwin’s release dribbling down into his underwear.

“I know. I’m really sorry.” His tone was muted, though he wasn’t surprised. He wasn’t sure what they had done, or why they had done it. No, he knew why. Because he wanted to, because he was the one that always needed to hold back because Levi wouldn’t — Levi had always been honest about his feelings.

Levi’s mouth opened when Erwin focused on him again. He knew whatever came out would be unpleasant. He tried to brace himself for it, but he closed it again when the sound of the cellar door creaked open.

“Erwin?” Marie’s voice called out, uncertain and gentle. He drew in a breath and watched Levi stand to his full height, flinching at the sound of Erwin’s wife. “You down here, honey?”

Levi walked towards the stairs, disappearing from Erwin’s eyeline as he climbed the steps. His sweater was a little pinched at the shoulder, where Erwin’s teeth had bitten into it. He hoped his wife wouldn’t notice.

“Hey Marie.” Levi’s voice was clean, calm. Erwin remembered how he had whimpered beneath him barely five minutes ago. Guilt wrapped tight to his throat, merging with the grief burning him up.

“Oh. I was told Erwin was down here,” Erwin heard Marie, soft and a little unsure. 

Maybe she would know, maybe she would pick up on it and Erwin would have to deal with the outcome. He braced himself, clutching at his slacks like a child, pinching the fabric until it creased up.

Levi’s voice came through smooth, loud enough that it was clearly meant to be overheard by Erwin as well. “Erwin just needed some space. He got overwhelmed with his grief for a moment. He’ll be up in a minute.”

Chapter 6: History Retold - Zevi Missing Scene
Levi had been dating Zeke for three months. Three entire months with a man who caught Levi’s eye in the coffee shop he worked at. A man who was new, who had known nothing of him. Levi wasn’t used to new people in his life; it had been uncomfortable accepting any kind of strangeness. Zeke was awkward, a little patronising, but Levi didn’t mind. Their strangeness grew around one another. It was time for Levi to move on. Erwin hadn’t loved him for years, had continually picked Marie over him. He’d begged Erwin, hadn’t he? Tried to encourage him to see the truth, because it was never one sided, no matter what everyone said.

But then people questioned why Levi was still alone. Even Mr Smith, and Levi hated it. It made him squirm, the idea of people thinking of him as pathetic. Even as Erwin moved across the country, even as Erwin came back just to tell him he was getting married.

It sucked. It sucked so badly to not have given himself over to Erwin — that they never got around to fucking. He’d wanted it so badly every time Erwin had pulled him close in that narrow bed in his old apartment. The way Erwin’s hands felt on his body, and his mouth over his own. He’d wanted it with Erwin, but then those thoughts closed in around him. The way the filth dripped off him, the way Erwin touched him. Familiar to how it had been before so that it merged, so that he felt he was tainting Erwin with the memory, blending the horror.

Erwin had accepted that they needed to wait until Levi was ready. It hadn’t seemed to matter all that much. Or at least, he never pushed Levi in any direction. It was only when Levi figured he was ready for more that Erwin backed away, left him crying pathetically on the floor of his shitty apartment.

At that point, he didn’t think he’d be able to give anyone that. Better to keep himself sealed up like a tomb. Heart and body. After a time, it had worked. The burn he felt for Erwin adjusted into a low ache. He forgot about it sometimes, unless Erwin phoned him and he heard his soft voice on the phone, or when he caught pictures of Marie and Erwin online. At those points, he pushed his feelings aside. Levi was busy raising his kid, and he tried to build a better life for them — he was busy with work. He was too busy for anything else. 

But then Zeke showed up at the coffee shop — A young man who ordered the same vanilla latte every day and sat at the back of the store, typing away on his laptop. Levi had learned his order by heart, perfected it, and he liked the way Zeke’s eyes looked behind his glasses, a little bigger from the lenses. He had long eyelashes and pink cheeks from the heat of the shop.

It wasn’t a burning desire that Levi felt for him, but he liked the way Zeke smiled at him. When Levi agreed to go out with him, he almost seemed surprised. Levi liked how it felt when their hands met. Zeke’s palms were wide, his fingers long, covering the full size of Levi’s with ease. He liked to talk, and drink coffee and take Levi on dates where he could fill the silence with his commentary on film, and science, and politics.

“I’m sorry I can’t fuck you,” Levi said early on. Embarrassed. Zeke had walked him home, kissed him on the mouth, and held onto Levi’s waist gently, like he didn’t want to let go. His beard felt strange, but Levi didn’t dislike it.

They stood there staring at one another on the steps of his apartment. “I know you can’t fuck.”

Levi frowned. “How do you know?”

“No one willingly gets pregnant at thirteen. I presume that caused significant trauma. I’m okay with waiting. I’m not a tyrant.” Levi flinched. He hated how he flinched. How the damage was always so fuckin obvious. 

“I want to,” Levi insisted eventually. “In time.”

And they had left it alone at that. They went on more dates. He even slept over, and occasionally, Zeke took the three of them to baseball games, and never seem bothered by Isabel’s boisterous chatter. He’d made it clear early on that he didn’t want children, but he was good with her. Not like him. Levi quelled the stupid voices, trying to compare. Always trying to compare.

“There’s a book I think you should read. I started it after we began dating,” Zeke said a few weeks back. He was over for brunch. He drank sachets of cappuccino that Levi kept in for him without complaint, sipping out of Isabel’s mermaid Barbie mug. He was wearing a cream cable-knit sweater that was slightly bobbled. Levi took in the sight of him, sitting with his legs folded up beside him.

Zeke had been talking innately about the tech start up company before changing the subject. Levi half listened to him, half listened to Isabel starting an argument with her stuffed toys in her bedroom. Her favourite teddy talked back a little deeper through the walls, dropping the f-bomb that Isabel had all week. She’d been in trouble at school for cussing again. 

“What kind of book?” Levi said, pulling himself back. He’d talk with her later about it.

“The Body Keeps the Score.”

Levi snorted. “What kind of shitfuck name is that?”

“It’s about recognising and overcoming trauma,” Zeke said lightly. “I think it would do wonders for you and your issues.”

“My issues?”

“Your trauma.” Zeke hesitated. “Do you want me to pretend you don’t have any?”

“Is this because we haven’t fucked?”

Zeke’s laughed was so genuine that Levi quickly realised he’d had no real intent to harm with his words. His tone was strange and a little off-putting, but that was just Zeke. “You sound patronising again.”

“You sound like I’ve offended you,” Zeke offered. “That wasn’t the case. It wasn’t supposed to be the case. I was trying to be supportive.”

“Yeah, well, you know I’m not a strong reader. I’d spend so long trying to work out what the words say that I wouldn’t be able to make sense of it.” Levi remembered the huge tomes that Erwin used to bring to the old diner he worked in, back when they first knew one another. He softened at the memory, Erwin so young and eager, Levi barely more than a kid. 

“Honestly Levi, you’re not entirely illiterate. But it exists on audio. I could probably get you a copy.” Zeke paused, pushing his glasses up his nose. “And this isn’t about me wanting to fuck you. I mean, I would, but I would tell you rather that than mask the conversation in an inane conversation about books.”

Levi grunted. He sipped his tea. He leaned over and pressed his hand on top of Zeke’s, feeling guilty. It seemed to help a little. Zeke leaned over and kissed his temple.

 

Levi didn’t read the book, or listen to it, but he felt ready. He had kissed Zeke hard a few nights before, pressed down on his couch together. Levi had only half-squirmed when Zeke’s lips slipped to his neck. It was like a jolt of lightning up his spine. Levi twisted away, defending himself with his arms up.

“Not the neck?” Zeke said, moving Levi’s hands gently from his face.

“Sorry — i just.” He couldn’t explain it. He knew Zeke wouldn’t get it. He pulled him down, kissed him hard on his mouth, and threw a leg over his hip. Zeke shuddered on top of him.

“I think I’m ready,” he said, and Zeke had blinked at him behind his fogged-up lenses, his lips red and ripe.

They had planned it for tonight. Isabel had already been dropped off at her friend’s house with the promise to keep her language clean in front of her friend’s parents, at least. Zeke was taking him out for dinner, and then they would come back here. It would happen and Levi could finally move on and be normal.

He was cleaning his house furiously to stop any thoughts from sneaking in. He was going to have sex. He was going to get it out of the way, so that every time after would be easier. He didn’t mind if it wasn’t great. Zeke had admitted he probably wouldn’t last long. He hadn’t touched himself since he started dating Levi. Levi’s not sure why he told him that, but he didn’t judge.

“Well, at least one of us has read the damn self-help book,” Levi uttered beneath his breath, changing the sheets on his bed. He showered his skin red, sluicing off the top layer. He averted his eyes so that he didn’t have to look down at himself. Today was turning out to be a day where his thoughts leant heavy on the unkind. Zeke hadn’t even seen him naked.

“He wants me,” Levi said to the echoing bathroom. He just needed to be clean. He wanted to smell nice, to taste nice. He wanted to be good, so that Zeke had a nice time.

Levi had been at sex the last time he did it— or whatever he was supposed to call it. He’d been laughed and mocked. It had hurt, even when he tried to force his body to relax. He's been so young. 

Levi sucked in a breath when his heart raced under the steam. Stupid brain, stupid thoughts. All of him so fucked up, and for what? The one person he conceivably thought he could do this with didn’t want him, but Zeke was fun. He was okay. Levi liked the way he looked. He could fall asleep beside him and feel reasonably safe. That was more than most. That was acceptable. He should be able to do this. He knew it wasn't like before. He knew it.

Levi spent longer than he liked to think in the shower. The water was running freezing by the time he got out and it forced him to shiver into warm clothes. The cold shower had numbed everything else, though, and gave him a chance to circle around his spotless apartment, tweaking things here and there.

Zeke showed up around six thirty, smartly dressed and eager. He’d polished his shoes and paired them with dark slacks and a pale grey blazer with a loose shirt beneath it. He was wearing his father’s watch on his wrist, which Levi noticed when he made a deliberate motion of using it to check the time against their dinner reservation.

“That’s a nice watch,” Levi said, waiting for Zeke to launch into a story about his father as they left his apartment.

Levi wasn’t wearing a watch. He wasn’t wearing any jewelry. He had attempted to look halfway decent in the nicest black shirt he owned and a thrifted denim jacket from the junior section. Zeke had complimented him on it. 

The owners of the restaurant were two of Zeke’s friends. Two brothers he had known in college. He’d been talking about it pretty intensely for the last few weeks, but Levi’s stomach still flipped as their names were checked against the reservation list. Levi followed Zeke and the waiter through the restaurant until they were seated. It was furnished with reclaimed wood and dark green plants; dark and masculine. Levi kept his head tucked down, frowning when he noticed they were seated in front of the kitchen. The back of Levi’s neck prickled uncomfortably, certain he was being stared at. “Are your friends watching us?”

“You, a little.” Zeke sat up straight, and Levi watched his chest puff out a little across the table. “But only because you look so beautiful.”

A lie, a stupid, ugly lie about the stupid, ugly man Levi was, but he grimaced through a smile. He could feel the sweat building up beneath his arms and at the edges of his hairline.

“Okay.” 

The food was nice. Levi put the effort into complimenting it, though it sat heavy in his stomach and he made more effort pushing it around his plate than taking a bite. It made him feel nauseas, and he refused Zeke’s offer of alcohol, sticking to water instead. It was cool, a wash of relief down his throat.

“There is nothing to worry about. We don’t have to do anything you’re not ready for,” Zeke promised. He was drinking the locally brewed beer he’d recently invested in that his friends offered. He offered Levi a sip, but beer bloated him, made his head spin so he refused again. “We don’t have to do anything, Levi.”

“We are,” Levi promised. He leaned over, pressing his fingers into Zeke’s hands. “I want you.”

The rest of the dinner went fine enough. Zeke carried the conversation, but Levi nodded his head along. He was pleasant enough when Zeke’s curious friends came out and he was introduced as Zeke’s boyfriend.

Levi was itching for another shower when they got back to his apartment. The history of himself — all the filth leaking out of him. Zeke didn’t seem to notice. His arm remained tucked over Levi’s waist, holding him close as Levi unlocked.

Levi slipped off to the bathroom. He couldn’t to look himself in the eye. He didn’t want to see his reflection, couldn’t bear the idea of what he would see. His hands shook either side of the sink, and he stared at his knuckles bursting white with the tight grip.

Zeke was sitting on the edge of the bed when Levi walked in from the bathroom. He’d already taken his glasses off, propping them up on the side, and Levi hadn’t seen him without them before. He stood up when he caught sight of Levi, waving his hand awkwardly. Zeke kissed him, sinking down to lessen the gap between them. Levi’s hands were red raw from washing them and he felt a little dizzy, but Zeke held him close, keeping him upright. 

Levi could not remember his first kiss. There were lots of things he couldn’t recall. A hazy darkness, a weird tightness in his chest that pulled his stomach apart and had him retching. He had learned to push those thoughts away, every bad touch replaced with the way it had felt when Erwin's hands fell over him. The way he knew, even without Levi having to divulge anything.

“I could just finger you, or we could do oral stuff,” Zeke said as he pulled back. He pinched Levi’s chin between his thumb and pointer, forcing Levi looked up at him. Zeke’s cheeks were flushed, bringing out the blue in his eyes. He’d been patient, Levi had lost one lover because he hadn’t been able to share himself in the way he wanted to. He didn’t want to go through that again.

“I want you inside me.” The words held power, Levi knew that much. He remembered it being a placation back before, in the time he was trying hard not to think about. He pulled on Zeke’s hands, tugging him over towards the bed. 

Zeke’s smile was soft, his sharp teeth flashing. “I’d like that a lot.”

Levi lost the next five minutes. He found himself in the past again, paralysed. When he came back around, he couldn’t recall losing his clothes, but he was naked on the bed with Zeke kneeling between his thighs, a foiled condom tight between teeth. He was naked too, slim but fit. He had dark blond hair like a golden rug over his chest, two small pink nipples. His cock was hard, leaking at the tip.

Levi’s fingers twisted tight in the sheets. He kept seeing things. Zeke wasn’t Zeke anymore, but morphing into the face and figure of someone he desperately tried to leave behind.

“We can stop at any point,” Zeke was back again, or at least the figure had Zeke’s voice, and his cold slippery fingers pressed between Levi’s legs. Lube. Where had it come from? Yes, they’d bought it together with the condoms before coming back here. Levi had rolled his face into Zeke’s chest when they’d purchased, breathing in the scent of his strong cologne. Levi needed it, was too dry without it. That would make it easier. 

“Please,” Levi said. It didn’t sound like his voice, sounded younger, softer. He leaned up, grabbing onto Zeke’s shoulders, and pulling him down. No, he was Levi. He wasn’t a child anymore. He was a man, and Zeke was his boyfriend. The man he probably didn’t love, but liked well enough. Most everyone else in the world seemed able to fuck for less.

“You’re so beautiful.” Zeke’s fingers moved over Levi’s sides, bumping over his ribs as they protruded with every exhale. He’d struggled to eat this last week, thinking about it, on what he wanted from Zeke. It didn’t seem to show as much as he feared. “I just want to eat you up.”

Zeke’s beard brushed coarsely over Levi’s stomach as he bent down. Levi closed his eyes, fingers digging tighter into the bed. He wanted this. He wanted Zeke. He wanted this. He wanted this. This was Zeke.

Levi squeezed his eyes shut when Zeke’s sloppy tongue slicked against him. It should feel nice, it would feel nice if Levi could relax. If he could think. Absurdly, he wondered a little late if he should’ve waxed.

“Oh, maybe I shouldn’t have lubed you first. I can’t taste you properly this way,” Zeke said, lifting his head. His lips were shiny. Levi swallowed, and it hurt in his throat. “Oh Levi, look at you. God, I can’t wait to be inside you. Are you sure? You’ve gone quiet.”

“Put it inside. I want it.” Levi insisted, opening his legs. It felt like an old routine. He turned his head to the side, squeezed his eyes tight. The sound of the foil ripping, Zeke’s stifled moans as he smoothed the condom over his cock. Zeke was a good man. He was an average man. He was where Levi wanted him.

It didn’t hurt. Levi was expecting it to hurt. The squelching sound of lube making him sound wet, and the slap of their bodies as Zeke moved inside him. Levi held him close, wrapped his arms over his shoulders because he remembered that being the thing to do. He didn’t want to get into trouble, and he wanted Zeke to have a good time. Zeke deserved it. He deserved it. 

After a while, Levi’s hands slipped from around Zeke. He was moaning, making sounds Levi hadn’t heard from him before, telling Levi he was beautiful. He was perfect. How often he had thought about this. Levi laid there. He laid there and let Zeke fuck him. He was good at being fucked. He hadn’t been fucked in such a long time. There had been chances, people that had wanted him, that had looked at him long enough for Levi to pick up on the signs. There had been Erwin once, who Levi had shied away from touching until it was too late and his interest in Levi had dried up. Once his father had worked it out, once Marie had come along, he’d never looked back. 

Not a surprise. Not a surprise with the way Levi was. With the way he looked, the way he behaved, the way his body practically wept the filth from his pores. Unclean. Filth—

—Zeke must have finished. He must have because Levi came back to himself staring up at the ceiling. He felt sore between his legs, and when he lifted his hand, it was shaking. His entire body was shaking.

“I stopped,” Zeke said, and Levi jumped, grabbing the sheets and trying to pull them over his body. He was on top of the covers, Zeke was beside him, wearing his boxers and pulling on his socks. Levi must have… he must have. His mind had slipped again.

Levi stared at Zeke, at the abstract of him. How his shoulders were freckled and a little bony. Levi hadn’t realised. He’d never noticed that. Zeke was real. Zeke was his average man, the man interested in him. The man that took him to dinner in front of his friends as if Levi was something worth showing off.

Zeke leaned over to touch him, and Levi moved away. 

“Don’t touch me!” 

Zeke raised his hands, palms outwards and stood up from the bed. “You weren’t in the room with me, so I stopped. Did you wish it was him?”

Levi shook his head. It wasn’t Zeke, and it wasn’t Erwin. 

Erwin.

Levi wanted him. Now the thought of him made him ache even more. He wanted Erwin to still live in the same city so he could call him, so he could come here. And Levi wouldn’t have to deal with this. They never… it was always Levi having to help Erwin out of a crisis, but this time he could be here. He would see Levi and help him and stop the stupid thoughts from taking over. He knew everything without knowing a thing.

“Levi. I don’t really know what to say.”

Levi couldn’t see. The room was spinning and his throat ached. Why was Zeke here? Why did Levi let him? Why did Zeke have to see through it, to realise? Why couldn’t he have just fucked Levi properly and force him to get over it?

“Get out. Get the fuck out and don’t look at me. Get the fuck out, get out, get out.” He repeated the mantra over and over. Quiet at first, before raising it. He repeated it as the blur of Zeke and his clothes left the room. He heard his front door close shut and the walls suddenly shrank in on him.

Erwin. He wanted Erwin.

No. He stripped his sheets from the bed and threw them into the washer. He found the used condom, the bottle of lube. He tossed them into the trash. He sat in his bathtub as the water ran around him. He needed to be clean. He needed Erwin. He needed Erwin to be here to hold him. Erwin.

He sat in the water, knees drawn up to his chest and arms wrapped around them. The tears burned as they chased down his skin, as he slipped from the past to the present and everything he ruined. He waited until the water cooled around him. His phone was on the side. His phone. Erwin. He could call Erwin and he could tell him about that lawsuit. Yeah, that lawsuit. He could bore Levi to sleep with it, with his gentle voice and his familiarity, his kindness. Levi reached over, sniffing, dragging the back of his knuckles beneath his puffy eyes.

 

Levi didn’t really sleep, but he’d felt a little better for the conversation with Erwin. The visions disappeared. They changed to the things Erwin said to him. How he would let Levi rest against his chest, how they would watch a movie and how Levi could feel his heartbeat. In the end, he hadn’t wanted to hang up, but Erwin had to go back to his wife, even if he couldn’t admit it. 

But feeling sad that he wasn’t with Erwin was fine. It was better than before. In the morning, he had a proper shower, and he cleaned his teeth. His face was puffy and his skin dull, but he’d looked worse. He couldn’t face breakfast, but he called the parents of Isabel’s friend and asked if they could hold on to her for a little while longer. No bother. They’d take her to the movies.

Then he remembered Zeke. He remembered how he treated him the night before. How excited he’d been, how Levi had let him carry on even when he’d slipped into the wrong headspace. He grabbed his phone again, scrolling to Zeke’s name.

He’s had no missed calls from him, so he was surprised when Zeke answered on the second ring. Levi didn’t give him a chance to speak, cutting in just as he heard the low tone of his voice.

“I’m sorry. I was an asshole.”

“Well,” Zeke was outside. Levi could hear the traffic in the background. Maybe he was on his way to another cafe, maybe he would stop attending the one Levi worked in and find somewhere else to get his vanilla lattes. Something small pinched Levi’s chest at the thought. “I suppose neither of us took much care into thinking realistically about what it would be like.”

“I wanted it.”

Zeke made a disgruntled noise, like he disagreed but didn’t want to argue. “I should have done more research. I don’t think I helped things.”

“I just started seeing stuff that I knew wasn’t happening. My thoughts got all fucked and twisted.”

“What happened in your past?”

“Yeah. Guess it got conflated in my head. It’s stupid. I know you wouldn’t.” Zeke was a lot of things. He was pompous and a little arrogant, but he would never do that. Levi trusted him not to. “I’m sorry. You deserve to be with someone normal that can fuck without making a scene.”

“You want to break up?”

Levi frowned. “You don’t?”

“I think we probably need to not do that again anytime soon, but I enjoy spending time with you. And you make the best vanilla lattes.”

Levi laughed, and it hurt his chest a little. “Is that part of the reason?”

“No! Not at all.” 

“Maybe you could come over later.” Levi thought about all the things Erwin had said he would do with him, if he was here, if he hadn’t left Levi to start a new life together with Marie. “We could watch a movie, or like cuddle. I don’t know. If you still want to.”

“Okay.” Zeke sounded unsure at first before clearing in his throat. “Yes, I would like that.”
