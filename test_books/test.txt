“Invite me nicer than that.”
Levi stared up at him for three long seconds. Erwin counted them with his own
breaths before Levi shrugged, eyes bouncing away.
“Come back with me, Blondie.”
“That’s the best I’m getting,” Erwin said with a laugh. No one could see them,
this far into the alley, and Hange had moved back into joining the party. Erwin
pressed his lips to the centre of Levi’s forehead, breathed in the scent of him.
“Come, let’s find a bus.”
They took the bus back to Levi’s apartment, sitting thigh to thigh on the bench,
not really speaking. At one point, he caught Levi’s hand in his own, and studied
his knuckles, a little scuffed from his fight. He said nothing, just rubbed them
softly with the pad of his thumb.
Afterward, Levi lifted onto his toes and kissed Erwin on his doorstop, because
he could, because there was no one to see him or judge. He mumbled his thanks to
the sitter, but then they were alone, pulling their clothes off to fall into
Levi’s bed together.
“Mikes presents were lame,” Levi’s breath was damp against Erwin’s mouth, curled
up as they were in his bed, in their underwear and loose t-shirts. Levi hadn’t
bought a gift, had come along more as a plus one to Erwin than anything else.
Erwin had purchased his friend a second juicer, so he didn’t complain about
Erwin borrowing his previous one. “What would be your best gift?”
Erwin rolled onto his back to think, smiling when Levi took that as a chance to
lean into his chest. “Anything in the world? I suppose. I would just want to see
myself happy. Settled. Perhaps passing the bar and successfully practicing. With
you and Izzy.”
“Thought you wanted to teach?” Levi teased and Erwin closed his eyes, slipped a
hand against Levi’s ribs beneath his shirt, not straying far, but just feeling
him warm and safe.
“What about you?”
“Remember last Christmas?” Levi said quietly. “When it was cold and Isabel was
so excited that we all took a walk and saw the batshit lights on that street.
We’d go to that. Then afterwards, you’d kiss me in your dad’s kitchen, the smell
of sugar and peppermints and cinnamon from all the baking he did. It’s kinda
dumb, I guess.”
“It’s a promise,” Erwin said, smiling. Levi’s hands would be cold after a walk
like that. Erwin would like to press a kiss to the back of each hand, watch his
dark lashes flicker and his small gasp when their lips would bump. He always
seemed so surprised whenever Erwin kissed him.
“Good.” Levi leaned forward, pressed their mouths together now, legs wrapped
around each other beneath the covers.

Chapter Notes
Another long one... I hope the pacing is okay - keeping the balance between the
past and present is tricky at times!
Thank you again for the feedback and being so nice for my first tour into
writing Eruri fic.
Also...this is quite angsty. Chapter warnings in the end notes

Telling his father hadn’t seemed like such a big deal. It was starting small. It
was telling the most important person in his life, before they moved on to
friends. Before they made it official in any sort of capacity. Before they had
sex, even though Levi was getting more brazen, slithering into Erwin’s lap when
he’d put Izzy to bed, kissing at his jawline and pressing himself down over
Erwin, promising he was ready even if he flinched every time Erwin touched him
unexpectedly.
His father had worried last Christmas, because Levi was underage, and maybe the
idea of Erwin sleeping with another boy was surprising, but it was different
now. Erwin was different, Levi was an adult.
He mentioned it over coffee in his father’s shop. He’d taken the day off to see
him. Hadn’t told Levi. With the sun bright in the sky, it highlighted the dust
sparkling over the knickknacks. There was a golden mirror sitting on a heavy
wooden chest. It looked tarnished and mottled. Levi would have a seizure at the
sight.
“Levi and I,” Erwin said, when they moved on from safer topics like his most
recent semester and how the family is doing. “Levi and I, our relationship
changed recently. We’re wanting to make a go of it as a couple.”
Erwin’s father’s face stilled, his lips drawn thin amongst his beard. “Oh,
Erwin. I had hoped our conversation last year would put an end to anything like
this.”
“I didn’t think you were narrow enough to be disappointed,” Erwin said, feeling
disappointment settle into an ache over his bones, souring his stomach as it
clenched. He placed the coffee on the table, fingers pressing to his lips. His
thoughts shuffled about him, tried to swallow back resentment as he steadied
himself for a poor reaction.
“Erwin, son. It’s not that. But if this thing burns out between the two of you,
who will take care of him then?”
“We’re not going to burn out,” Erwin said. “And Levi takes care of himself.”
“You’re both very young.” Erwin watched his father pool his face in his hands,
fingers pressed beneath his glasses. “You are made for so much, son. You should
go out there and see the world. Finish your studies and take the bar exam. I
don’t want you sacrificing things because you’ve met someone, someone who might
not even be suited to your world.”
