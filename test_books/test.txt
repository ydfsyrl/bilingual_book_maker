“Why?” Erwin pushed Levi’s hands away when he moved to do up the jacket. Erwin could do it. He wasn’t completely devoid of ability. His head ached. He wanted to brush his teeth with a whole tube of toothpaste, wanted to guzzle a gallon of mouthwash. Wanted to be left alone. Wanted mostly to sink back to what felt like yesterday to him, back to the life he had created for himself in San Francisco.
“That’s between the two of you,” Levi said — and when he noticed Erwin looking at him, he sighed, bunching his hands into his pocket. “You just didn’t work out.”
It was a slow walk from ward to the parking lot, but Erwin took his time. He would not take the wheelchair offered, and while his brain still felt sluggish, while his stomach twisted itself in knots about the unreality of his new reality, he persevered. Levi was quiet beside him.
“I remember this car,” Erwin said, once they had made it to the aforementioned vehicle. His head continued to ache, but the constant throb was a soothing distraction to the panic. The car smelled of pine from the tree dangling from the rearview mirror; polish from where Levi had cleaned the dashboard. Erwin breathed it in, watching the landscape change through the window. Painkillers rattled in the paper bag on his lap. He’d look through it at some point. They said there was unlikely to be any lasting damage, but he wasn’t to be alone for the next 48 hours. It would take time. He might recover some memories here and there. It might work out.
The car was an old Ford Escort. Levi had bought it with two years’ worth of tip-money from the diners he’d worked in and even then Erwin hadn’t been convinced it was worth it. The paintwork had been chipped, and it was more dented than smooth, but Levi had been proud of it for years. Now it had a paint job bringing it to a slick black, the dents beaten out of it. It had been a clunky drive on the few occasions Erwin had driven around in it, but it had been Levi’s baby. His second, less temperamental one.
“You never wanted to change it up?”
“If it works, I’m driving it,” Levi said. “It’s not had much action recently. You uh. Your car was better but—”
Levi had finished with a shrug, and Erwin didn’t respond. He was embarrassed and there was no argument to be had, anyway. He wondered what model he drove, whether it was salvageable from the crash. Back in San Francisco, he’d had a sporty Porsche that he drove, though he’d always been a little embarrassed by it.
They drove further out of the heavy traffic surrounding the hospital, past the university they had met at, when Levi had been cleaning lectures that Erwin was too advanced to take part in. They drove past where Erwin had his apartment with Mike and Hange back in the day, before they started their new lives.
They drove beyond the city limits until it evened out into a quieter neighbourhood with more trees and wider streets. He had a vague recollection as they drove through streets line with traditional row houses, the bottom floors opened up into storefronts. Levi had worked at a coffee shop along here once. He’d had an apartment above a florist’s and Isabel’s school had been only a few blocks away.
“This isn’t my home. I live in Lower Haight, San Francisco.” Erwin realised it the moment he vocalised it, and it sat tight in his chest, rattling just as much as his head throbbed beneath the cloud of pain meds he was doped up on.
“It’s our home,” Levi said, punctuating the second word. “We live in this neighbourhood.” Erwin’s palms itched and his scalp dampened with sweat as they drove through the streets.
“So I lost the house and my wife,” Erwin said. Something ached in his chest for the first time as reality set in, just to add to his foggy misery. Losing Marie, losing those Christmases tucked up in the alcove of their living room, the heady green tree losing its needles to the floor. The concrete slopes of the city they called home, so many miles away from the East Coast. “Now I’m back in a city I thought I’d left behind.”
