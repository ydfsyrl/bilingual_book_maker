“Remember last Christmas?” Levi said quietly. “When it was cold and Isabel was so excited that we all took a walk and saw the batshit lights on that street. We’d go to that. Then afterwards, you’d kiss me in your dad’s kitchen, the smell of sugar and peppermints and cinnamon from all the baking he did. It’s kinda dumb, I guess.”
“It’s a promise,” Erwin said, smiling. Levi’s hands would be cold after a walk like that. Erwin would like to press a kiss to the back of each hand, watch his dark lashes flicker and his small gasp when their lips would bump. He always seemed so surprised whenever Erwin kissed him.
“Good.” Levi leaned forward, pressed their mouths together now, legs wrapped around each other beneath the covers.

Chapter Notes
Another long one... I hope the pacing is okay - keeping the balance between the past and present is tricky at times!
Thank you again for the feedback and being so nice for my first tour into writing Eruri fic.
Also...this is quite angsty. Chapter warnings in the end notes

Telling his father hadn’t seemed like such a big deal. It was starting small. It was telling the most important person in his life, before they moved on to friends. Before they made it official in any sort of capacity. Before they had sex, even though Levi was getting more brazen, slithering into Erwin’s lap when he’d put Izzy to bed, kissing at his jawline and pressing himself down over Erwin, promising he was ready even if he flinched every time Erwin touched him unexpectedly.
His father had worried last Christmas, because Levi was underage, and maybe the idea of Erwin sleeping with another boy was surprising, but it was different now. Erwin was different, Levi was an adult.
He mentioned it over coffee in his father’s shop. He’d taken the day off to see him. Hadn’t told Levi. With the sun bright in the sky, it highlighted the dust sparkling over the knickknacks. There was a golden mirror sitting on a heavy wooden chest. It looked tarnished and mottled. Levi would have a seizure at the sight.
